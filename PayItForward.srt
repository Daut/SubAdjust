I'll kill her!

I'm a reporter.
I'm with the press,

How long have
you guys been here?

14
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:55,087
Get out of here!

15
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,223
Is this domestic
or drugs?

16
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:57,225
Is that
his girlfriend

17
00:01:57,277 --> 00:01:58,227
Or what?
Get out of here!

18
00:01:58,279 --> 00:01:59,229

00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:00,231
Come on,
talk to me.

please get him

21

Out of here.
Walk!

I got my passes, masius.

every right

Where'd he go?

Having a little
car trouble?

37
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,348
That's a keen
observation.

38
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:20,885
I can help you.

39
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:24,893
It's the jag.

40
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:27,430
You want me
to drive home

41
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:28,617
In your car?

42
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:30,603
No. I want you
to take my car.

43
00:03:30,656 --> 00:03:34,209
Had a lot of luck lately.
I don't need it.

44
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:36,798
You're giving me
a brand-new jaguar,

45
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:38,169
And you don't
want anything?

46
00:03:38,254 --> 00:03:40,889
Well, I can prove it.
Give me your card.

48
00:03:50,077 --> 00:03:52,412

What is this?

50
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:54,835
What--what?
Do you want me

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,120
To kill your wife
or something?

52
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:58,957
No. Tempting, but, no.

53
00:03:59,011 --> 00:04:02,380
Call it generosity
between 2 strangers.

54
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:06,504
Generosity? Hey, fella,
it's a jaguar.

55
00:04:06,558 --> 00:04:07,608
You expect me
to drive off

56
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:09,228
In a brand-new jaguar,
and that's it?

57
00:04:09,314 --> 00:04:10,297
That's right.

58
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,717
Hey! You're a freak.
You know that?

59
00:04:11,802 --> 00:04:13,052
You are a freak.

60
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:14,638
You want me
to get in this car?

61
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:16,976
No way. It's probably
going to blow up.

62
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,029
Yeah. That's real funny.

63

raining down

In the street.

Ha ha. You think

66
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,524
I'm going near
that thing? You're nuts!

67
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,528
Besides, I've got a car.

68
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:30,402
Sort of.

Cool blade, huh?

73
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:29,566
Want to see
your guts--

74
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:31,286
Keep it in your pants.

75
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:34,293
Fag.

76
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:36,245
He's going
to kill you.

77
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:37,831
I got pepper spray.

Apparently none of you
have ever seen

82

A new teacher before.

83
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:31,869
I'm mr. Simonet.

84
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:35,441
Welcome to the seventh
grade, middle school--

85
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,830
That hellish,
shaky bridge

86
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,084
You all must cross
before you become

87
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:42,639
Members of
that undyingly enviable

88
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:44,160
High-school elite.

89
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:46,029
Now, some of you might
think you can't get

90
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:47,466
Across this bridge
fast enough,

91
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,952
That you'd rather
hold your breath,

92
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:50,505
Close your eyes,
and not think

93
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:52,024
About anything
until it's all over.

94
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:55,212
Well, I'm here
to tell you

95
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:58,201
That that is not
an option in this class.

Tardiness--

100
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,721
To be late
for your first class

101
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:09,241
On your first day
of school,

102
00:07:09,326 --> 00:07:11,411
What does that indicate?

103
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:13,949
I'm having
a bad hair day.

104
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:15,019
[students laugh]

105
00:07:15,072 --> 00:07:16,889
Perhaps
what it indicates

106
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:18,692
Is a lack of respect.

107
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:21,096
You see, I'm going
to be here every day

108
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:22,316
For you.

109
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:26,054
And so, I expect you
to be here for me.

110
00:07:26,143 --> 00:07:30,346
On time. No excuses.

111
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:31,551
Put that down.

112
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:33,320
[whispering]
wait.

113
00:07:35,026 --> 00:07:36,944
Now...

114
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,899
This class is
social studies.

115
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:43,790
That is you
and the world.

116
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:46,595
Yes, there is
a world out there,

117
00:07:46,682 --> 00:07:48,883
And even if you decide
you don't want

118
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:49,936
To meet it,
it's still

119
00:07:50,022 --> 00:07:52,807
Going to hit you
right in the face.

120
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:54,779
Believe me.

121
00:07:54,864 --> 00:07:57,449
So, best you start
thinking about

122
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:58,453
The world now

123
00:07:58,538 --> 00:08:01,607
And what it means
to you.

124
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:05,214
What does the world
mean to you?

125
00:08:06,838 --> 00:08:09,223
Come on! A little class
participation here.

126
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:11,260
Is it just this class
you want to get out of?

127
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:12,897
Your house? Your street?

128
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:16,068
Any further any of you
want to go than that?

129
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:17,072
Yes.

130
00:08:17,107 --> 00:08:18,858
The mall.
That's only,

131
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:20,445
Like, 2 miles
away from me.

132
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:24,000
Well, let me ask you
another question.

133
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,705
How often do you
think about things

134
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:28,793
That happen outside
of this town?

135
00:08:28,847 --> 00:08:31,248
You watch the news? Yes?

136
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:32,585
No?

137
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,338
All right. So we're
not global thinkers yet,

138
00:08:35,426 --> 00:08:36,759
But why aren't we?

139
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:40,883
'cause we're 11.

140
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,087
Good point.
What's your name?

141
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:44,457
Trevor.

142
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:46,594
Maybe trevor's
absolutely right.

143
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,047
Why should we think
about the world?

144
00:08:48,134 --> 00:08:49,768
I mean, after all,
what does the world

145
00:08:49,803 --> 00:08:50,770
Expect of us?

146
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:52,505
Expect?

147
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,276
Mm-mmm. Of you.

148
00:08:54,312 --> 00:08:57,948
Mr. Simonet: What does
the world expect of you?

149
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,889
Nothing.

150
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:03,093
Nothing.

151
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:06,382
My god, boys and girls,
he's absolutely right.

152
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:08,437
Nothing.

153
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:10,356
I mean, here you are.
You can't drive.

154
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:12,277
You can't vote. You can't
even go to the bathroom

155
00:09:12,313 --> 00:09:14,865
Without a pass from me.
You're stuck!

156
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:17,903
Right here,
in the seventh grade.

157
00:09:19,878 --> 00:09:23,247
But not forever.

158
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:26,169
Because one day,
you'll be free.

159
00:09:26,223 --> 00:09:28,008
[students cheering]

160
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:33,200
All right. But what if
on that day you're free,

161
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:36,155
You haven't prepared,
you're not ready,

162
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,476
And then
you look around you

163
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:41,064
And you don't like
what the world is?

164
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:42,870
What if the world...

165
00:09:42,955 --> 00:09:46,992
Is just
a big disappointment?

166
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:48,664
We're screwed.

167
00:09:48,717 --> 00:09:50,551
Unless--

168
00:09:50,636 --> 00:09:54,506
Unless you take the things
that you don't like

169
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:57,980
About this world and
you flip them upside down

170
00:09:58,018 --> 00:09:59,985
Right on their ass--
don't tell your parents

171
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:03,991
I used that word--
and you can start that...

172
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,530
Today!

173
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:09,904
This is
your assignment.

174
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:11,841
Extra credit.

175
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:15,714
It goes on
all year long.

176
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:17,203
[students groan]

177
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:18,538
Now, wait a minute.
What?

178
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,874
What? What's wrong
with this?

179
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:20,877
What's the matter?

180
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:21,879
Yes?

181
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,914
It's--it's, like, so--

182
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:27,019
So what? There must

Someone help her?

Weird.

185
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:30,478
Crazy.

186
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:31,480
Hard.

187
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:32,482
Bummer.

188
00:10:32,517 --> 00:10:34,852
Bummer. Hard.

189
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:40,161
How about possible?

190
00:10:42,704 --> 00:10:43,921
It's possible.

191
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:49,245
The realm of possibility

192
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,802
Exists where

193
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:53,222

195

So you can do it.

196
00:11:00,454 --> 00:11:03,106
You can surprise us.

197
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,794
It's up to you.

198
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,930
Or you can
just sit back

199
00:11:06,984 --> 00:11:09,569
And let it atrophy.

200
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:13,109
Atrophy.

201
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:14,830
If there is
a word you hear

202
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:16,132
That you don't
understand,

203
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:17,636
There's a dictionary
at the front of the room.

204
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:19,589
Look it up.

205
00:11:19,642 --> 00:11:21,292
And there are
these dictionaries,

206
00:11:21,344 --> 00:11:23,729
Which you will carry
with you at all times,

207
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,485
Because in this class,
we're going to learn

208
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:29,306
To love words
and their meanings.

209
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,861
Any questions?

210
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:32,830
Trevor: Yeah.

211
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,367
So you'll,

212
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:35,536
If we
don't change

213
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:36,539
The world?

214
00:11:36,624 --> 00:11:38,324
Well, no.
I wouldn't do that.

215
00:11:38,377 --> 00:11:42,214
But you might just
squeak by with a "c."

216
00:11:45,758 --> 00:11:49,127
What'd you ever do
to change the world?

217

Students: Whoa!

218
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:55,424
Well, trevor, I get
a good night's sleep,

00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,545
I eat a hearty
breakfast,

I show up on time,

221
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:05,475
And then I pass
the buck to you.

222
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:10,903
Now, I want you all
to write your names

223
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,541
In these books,
and--what's your name?

224
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:15,213
Molly? All right.

225
00:12:15,298 --> 00:12:18,050

No. You went
straight to hell.

229
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,468

Oh, no, no.

00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:42,195
Not for me.
Thank you.

234
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,197
You cannot
get in trouble.

00:15:43,232 --> 00:15:44,199
We bought it
for you.

00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:45,200
I thank you

Oh, come on.
Why not?

239
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:48,239

I promised my kid.

it means?

My suggestion to you is
if you want to know,

00:24:51,152 --> 00:24:52,602
Why don't you go home
and talk to your son.

00:24:54,057 --> 00:24:55,675
Really?
Then why did you come

366
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,060
All the way down here
to ask me

367
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:59,014
What the assignment is?

368
00:25:00,854 --> 00:25:02,571
It's not a state secret.

369
00:25:05,847 --> 00:25:07,598
Yeah! And?

370
00:25:07,684 --> 00:25:10,886
It's an assignment
I give out

371
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,658
At the beginning
of every year to inspire.

372
00:25:12,693 --> 00:25:13,827
I don't expect them

373
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:15,362
To actually change
the world, the whole--

374
00:25:15,415 --> 00:25:16,699
You expect them
to change the--

375
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:18,368
Excuse me.
It's to get them to think,

376
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,238
Not walk on water.
It's a very good assignment.

377
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:21,241
You give them
an assignment

378
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:22,243
You don't think
they can do.

379
00:25:22,295 --> 00:25:23,545
What kind of teacher
are you?

380
00:25:23,597 --> 00:25:25,682
I didn't say that.
You know, they make attempts.

381
00:25:25,718 --> 00:25:27,269
Every now and then, they
clean up a little graffiti

382
00:25:27,355 --> 00:25:28,372
Before
they lose interest.

383
00:25:28,424 --> 00:25:29,374
Hey! This is my kid!

384
00:25:29,426 --> 00:25:30,593
You don't know him.

385
00:25:30,678 --> 00:25:32,996
You tell him
he can do something,

386
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,249
He's going
to believe you.

387
00:25:34,335 --> 00:25:35,251
And when he can't,

388
00:25:35,337 --> 00:25:36,770
It's going
to wipe him out.

389
00:25:36,856 --> 00:25:38,023
They ought
to fire your ass

390
00:25:38,076 --> 00:25:39,860
Out of here
right now!

391
00:25:39,912 --> 00:25:42,880
Well, you know,
they probably won't do that,

392
00:25:42,935 --> 00:25:45,019
Because I fill
a very excellent quota.

393
00:25:45,072 --> 00:25:48,024
I'm just this side
of parking in the blue zone.

394
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:49,095
Oh, so you think

395
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,230
You can do
whatever you want

396
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:51,816
Just 'cause
your face is messed up?

397
00:25:53,906 --> 00:25:56,390
Mrs. Mckinney, why don't you
put down in writing

398
00:25:56,444 --> 00:25:58,746
Your little and loud complaints,
and I'll make sure

399
00:25:58,832 --> 00:26:00,700
They get put
in the suggestion box.

400
00:26:04,443 --> 00:26:06,244
Jesus.

401
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,531
You are
really somethin'.

402
00:26:08,584 --> 00:26:10,735
Thanks. I appreciate
the euphemism.

403
00:26:10,822 --> 00:26:13,073
I've always wanted
to be somethin'.

404
00:26:21,024 --> 00:26:23,025
Man: Can I help you
with something, miss?

405
00:26:23,078 --> 00:26:25,863
Oh. Uh, no.

406
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:37,687
Mr. Thorsen! Hey!

407
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:38,923
Hey, hold up, man.
Come on,

408
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,560
I've been waiting
all day for you.

409
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:42,763
Hey. Hey, why won't
you return my calls?

410
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,950
We're not friends.

411
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,436
You know, I got
the pink slip for the car,

412
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:46,905
And that's quite
a stocking stuffer.

413
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,325
Are you gonna tell me
you can't accept it?

414
00:26:48,411 --> 00:26:49,878
No, no. That would
make me a moron.

415
00:26:49,913 --> 00:26:50,946
I just want to know
about these,

416
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:52,299
Uh, these instructions
you left me.

417
00:26:52,385 --> 00:26:54,285
Just do what they say.
Pay it forward.

418
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:55,305
Why?

419
00:26:55,391 --> 00:26:56,290
Because you've
accepted the car.

420
00:26:56,343 --> 00:26:57,292
You're obligated.

421
00:26:57,345 --> 00:26:58,511
I'm obligated.

422
00:26:58,597 --> 00:26:59,764
Well, what if I don't
feel obligated, huh?

423
00:26:59,816 --> 00:27:00,983
Well, what if I
just take my new car

424
00:27:01,068 --> 00:27:01,985
And get a couple hookers

425
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,020
And drive down
to mexico?

426
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:04,072
I'll never know.

427
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:05,358
But you'll what--
what is this?

428
00:27:05,443 --> 00:27:06,443
Come on, for real.

429
00:27:06,495 --> 00:27:08,196
An attack
of total altruism

430
00:27:08,282 --> 00:27:09,282
From a litigator.

431
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:10,501
I've got a meeting.

432
00:27:10,586 --> 00:27:12,871
I've got a story, ok?

433
00:27:12,957 --> 00:27:14,525
A senior partner
at channing and moss

434
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:15,911
Is giving away new cars?

435
00:27:15,947 --> 00:27:17,480
You could tell me a reason,
or I could make one up.

436
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:19,418
Mine will be a lot more
interesting, I promise.

437
00:27:19,453 --> 00:27:20,854
You've gone dotty.
You're wearing crystals.

438
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,142
You're keeping a few
too many cats at home, huh?

439
00:27:24,196 --> 00:27:27,265
All right. Look, all right?
Listen. Listen, please.

440
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:29,487
My ex-wife has
everything, ok? There.

441
00:27:29,573 --> 00:27:31,024
Plus she's
in a lesbian relationship,

442
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:32,643
I think,
just to piss me off.

443
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:34,664
Help me out, please.

444
00:27:39,342 --> 00:27:43,712
My daughter has asthma.
One night, it was very bad,

445
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:45,518
The worst I'd ever seen it.

446
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:47,105
It was the middle
of the night,

447
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,024
The emergency room.

448
00:27:49,111 --> 00:27:50,361
We were waiting forever.

449
00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:51,980
Couldn't get anyone
to pay attention.

450
00:27:52,032 --> 00:27:55,485
[man laughing]

451
00:28:02,253 --> 00:28:03,703
Her inhaler doesn't
seem to be working at all.

452
00:28:03,755 --> 00:28:05,689
Sorry. Mr. Parker.
What happened?

453
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:07,543
My sister,
she stabbed me.

454
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,546
I can't believe--

455
00:28:08,632 --> 00:28:09,882
Excuse me.
We were here first.

456
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:11,268
I'm sorry, we have to go
with stab wounds first.

457
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:12,770
She can't breathe.
She's very scared.

458
00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:13,857
Look,
I will let you know.

459
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:14,892
Mr. Thorsen:
Somebody has to see her.

460
00:28:14,977 --> 00:28:15,844
Nurse: I'm sorry.
It's protocol.

461
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:17,680
It's never been
this bad.

462
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:18,665
You have
to do something.

463
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:20,168
Sir, would you
just sit down?

464
00:28:20,254 --> 00:28:21,938
I'm sorry. We've
been here for 4 hours.

465
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,908
You need
to get a doctor.

466
00:28:23,944 --> 00:28:26,846
No. No, wait.
Hey, no. No!

467
00:28:26,934 --> 00:28:28,634
Would you excuse me?
Excuse me.

468
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,137
That's bullshit. You need
to help her right now!

469
00:28:30,223 --> 00:28:31,290
Excuse me?

470
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,225
No. No, why you give
me all this shit?

471
00:28:32,261 --> 00:28:33,261
Ain't you got
some oxygen

472
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:34,179
Or something
you can give her?

473
00:28:34,265 --> 00:28:35,515
Fine, let me--
no, no, no.

474
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,984
You don't need
to get no supervisor.

475
00:28:37,069 --> 00:28:38,737
You're the supervisor
of the day. Huh?

476
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:40,657
You are
the supervisor today.

477
00:28:40,744 --> 00:28:42,178
You feel me on that?
Now, I want you to take

478
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:43,513
Your skinny ass
down the hall,

479
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,600
Put the little girl
on a tray, and supervise her,

480
00:28:45,653 --> 00:28:48,271
And I want you to get her
some goddamn air!

481
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:49,842
I got your back, sis.

482
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,345
Oh, bitch, you still here?!
Shit!

483
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,964
[gunshots]

484
00:28:53,017 --> 00:28:55,518
Oh, shit ain't funny,
now, is it?

485
00:28:55,605 --> 00:28:58,440
Come on, man! No! No, man!
This ain't fair, man!

486
00:28:58,494 --> 00:29:01,629
Come on! Come on, man!
There! There!

487
00:29:01,684 --> 00:29:03,101
Mr. Thorsen:
I thanked him,

488
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:05,120
And there were some
very specific orifices

489
00:29:05,173 --> 00:29:07,341
In which I was told
to shove my thanks.

490
00:29:07,428 --> 00:29:09,729
He told me,
"just pay it forward."

491
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:11,650
3 big favors
for 3 other people.

492
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:12,836
That's it.

493
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:15,056
So, it's like
a "pass it on" thing, then.

494
00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:16,476
Wait a minute.
You and this lowlife

495
00:29:16,562 --> 00:29:17,846
Were in this chain
of do-gooders?

496
00:29:17,932 --> 00:29:19,682
Some kind of mother teresa
conga line?

497
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:21,603
That's a little new agey
for you, isn't it?

498
00:29:21,655 --> 00:29:22,688
Sort of tibetan?

499
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:24,324
What, are you
in a cult?

500
00:29:24,411 --> 00:29:26,495
If you mention
my name,

501
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:27,782
You'll be
selling your kidneys

502
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,501
To pay
for your lawsuit.

503
00:29:29,587 --> 00:29:31,154
Cult.

504
00:29:31,207 --> 00:29:32,156
Hey. The guy--

505
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:34,126
What was
the guy's name?

506
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:37,966
Sorry. I'm late
for my mass wedding.

507
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:57,320
[door squeaks]
[gasps]

508
00:29:57,374 --> 00:29:59,124
Hey!

509
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:07,357
I know
somebody's in here.

510
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,694
[clatter]
man: Oh.

511
00:30:09,748 --> 00:30:12,683
Arlene:
I know you're there.

512
00:30:12,737 --> 00:30:14,405
I want you to come out,

513
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,324
Or I will find you
and shoot you, I swear--

514
00:30:16,377 --> 00:30:20,213
Please don't shoot.

515
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:21,635
Please.

516
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:26,374
You stay right there.
If I see you move one--

517
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,362
[screams]

518
00:30:27,415 --> 00:30:29,166
[rifle fires]

519
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:34,493
Please don't
pick it up!

520
00:30:34,546 --> 00:30:36,997
Please don't.
I'm not moving.

521
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:40,955
Please.

522
00:30:42,344 --> 00:30:44,628
What are you doin'
on my truck?

523
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:48,851
Let me show you.
I'm just--

524
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,975
I'm just gonna
open the door, ok?

525
00:30:55,152 --> 00:30:57,820
[engine starts]

526
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:06,853
See, it might be easier
for you to sell now...

527
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,158
Now that it works.

528
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,360
I didn't ask
for your help.

529
00:31:09,412 --> 00:31:10,629
No.

530
00:31:10,665 --> 00:31:12,115
You been living
in my garage?

531
00:31:12,152 --> 00:31:14,169
No. Not after tonight.

532
00:31:14,238 --> 00:31:16,873
Look, can I come around?
I just wanna--

533
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,361
I got a handyman job
at the royal motel.

534
00:31:19,415 --> 00:31:20,364
They're giving me
a room.

535
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:21,750
You just
stay right there.

536
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:24,004
Please, I--I
don't like guns.

537
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:28,212
What is going on
with you and my son?

538
00:31:28,265 --> 00:31:29,932
He wanted
to help somebody,

539
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:31,819
Wanted to get somebody
back on their feet,

540
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,990
So he gave me
a little money.

541
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:35,360
He gave you money?

542
00:31:35,412 --> 00:31:36,779
Yes, ma'am.

543
00:31:36,865 --> 00:31:37,898
That's his savings.

544
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,536
Uh, well,
it's clothes and shoes,

545
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:43,926
And I got the job
off it.

546
00:31:44,012 --> 00:31:47,181
You think
you can keep it?

547
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:48,435
Looks to me like
you got yourself

548
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:50,939
A little problem.

549
00:31:55,017 --> 00:31:56,417
I can lick it.

550
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,055
How's that supposed
to happen all of a sudden?

551
00:31:59,108 --> 00:32:01,726
You ever
been on the street?

552
00:32:04,368 --> 00:32:05,952
My mom took us
pretty close.

553
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:08,489
Well, you can't know.

554
00:32:08,577 --> 00:32:11,545
Not until you're
looking at a dumpster.

555
00:32:11,582 --> 00:32:12,882
But when you climb
into that thing

556
00:32:12,918 --> 00:32:14,419
For the first time,

557
00:32:14,471 --> 00:32:16,555
And you pull those
newspapers over you,

558
00:32:16,592 --> 00:32:20,561
That's when you know that
you've messed your life up.

559
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,501
Somebody comes along
like your son

560
00:32:23,589 --> 00:32:25,623
And gives me a leg up,

561
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:28,161
I'll take it.

562
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:32,117
Even from a kid,
I'll take it.

563
00:32:32,172 --> 00:32:34,957
I...

564
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,779
I can't mess up again,
or I'll be dead.

565
00:32:38,835 --> 00:32:42,287
Look, I appreciate what
you're trying to do,

566
00:32:42,341 --> 00:32:43,375
Paying back trevor--

567
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,827
I'm not allowed
to pay back trevor.

568
00:32:44,912 --> 00:32:46,613
Then what is it
you're doing?

569
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:49,585
I'm paying it forward.

570
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:53,958
I know
you want me to go.

571
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,932
I'll go.

572
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:01,274
What's paying it forward?

573
00:33:01,362 --> 00:33:03,646
That's me.

574
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:07,952
That's me,
and that's 3 people...

575
00:33:10,328 --> 00:33:12,546
And I'm going
to help them,

576
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:14,801
But it has to be
something really big,

577
00:33:14,887 --> 00:33:20,458
Something they can't
do by themselves...

578
00:33:20,514 --> 00:33:23,233
So I do it for them.

579
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:28,257
Then they do it
for 3 other people...

580
00:33:28,312 --> 00:33:30,764
That's 9...

581
00:33:30,818 --> 00:33:34,771
And I do 3 more.

582
00:33:34,825 --> 00:33:39,445
That's 27, so, I'm
not really good at math,

583
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:42,787
But it gets big
really fast, you know?

584
00:33:42,841 --> 00:33:44,125
[all chattering]

585
00:33:44,177 --> 00:33:45,460
It's not gonna work.

586
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:50,785
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

587
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,373
A little articulation,
please.

588
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,493
Yes.

589
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:54,628
I think
it's a good idea.

590
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,598
Shawn?
It's stupid.

591
00:33:56,651 --> 00:33:57,601
Eugene: Adam?

592
00:33:57,653 --> 00:33:58,686
It's the honor system.

593
00:33:58,772 --> 00:33:59,805
People blow off
the honor system.

594
00:33:59,857 --> 00:34:00,740
So what?

595
00:34:00,775 --> 00:34:02,025
Just 'cause you do.

596
00:34:02,111 --> 00:34:04,963
Eugene: Well, trevor,
the class seems to think

597
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:08,152
That you've come up with
an overly utopian idea.

598
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,190
Look that word up
in a minute.

599
00:34:10,277 --> 00:34:14,463
Like a perfect world?

600
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:16,519
Mm-hmm.

601
00:34:16,606 --> 00:34:20,358
So?

602
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:25,668
So, what put this idea
in your head?

603
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:29,996
'cause...

604
00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:33,167
Everything sucks.

605
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:35,755
He talked to you
about this?

606
00:34:35,793 --> 00:34:40,496
We've had
our discussions. Yeah.

607
00:34:40,552 --> 00:34:42,269
But you don't
have to worry, though,

608
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:43,806
'cause I'll just--
I'll tell him

609
00:34:43,858 --> 00:34:45,458
We can't talk no more.

610
00:34:45,511 --> 00:34:48,297
No, um, don't do that.

611
00:34:50,137 --> 00:34:52,471
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

612
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:56,714
Yes, ma'am.

613
00:34:56,799 --> 00:34:58,850
Ok.

614
00:35:07,537 --> 00:35:10,572
Boy: I call the president,
like, to talk about pollution,

615
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,411
But my mom said now they're
gonna put us on some list,

616
00:35:13,499 --> 00:35:15,516
So she hung up.
[kids laugh]

617
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:18,371
For this assignment,
I put up recycling flyers

618
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:19,908
At 2 supermarkets.

619
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:22,129
I'm gonna put up
this website in chinese

620
00:35:22,165 --> 00:35:23,833
That's gonna tell
all the kids in china

621
00:35:23,885 --> 00:35:25,502
To jump up and down
at the same time.

622
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:35,203
The goal being to knock
the earth off its axis.

623
00:35:35,257 --> 00:35:36,207
Yeah.

624
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,209
Thank you.
Sit down, shawn.

625
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:39,195
[laughter]

626
00:35:39,248 --> 00:35:42,084
Well, your ideas
are as surprising

627
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,671
As they are variegated.

628
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:44,890
Add that
to your list of words

629
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,843
To look up
this evening.

630
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,063
But I want to focus
for a moment

631
00:35:48,149 --> 00:35:50,650
On one project
we heard today,

632
00:35:50,687 --> 00:35:53,188
Because I've been
teaching for many years,

633
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:55,225
And it really is
the first new idea

634
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:59,615
That also requires
an extreme act of faith

635
00:35:59,704 --> 00:36:01,838
In the goodness of people.

636
00:36:01,874 --> 00:36:07,095
Trevor has made an attempt
to interact with the world,

637
00:36:07,185 --> 00:36:09,052
And that was the assignment,

638
00:36:09,105 --> 00:36:10,922
And if I were
an effusive person

639
00:36:10,976 --> 00:36:15,296
Given to easy praise,
I would call that...

640
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:17,168
Admirable.

641
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:19,506
Now, here are the words
from today.

642
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:22,044
Utopian, enigma, quantum.
I'm gonna add variegated.

643
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,047
I want you
to go home tonight--

644
00:36:28,376 --> 00:36:29,342
Hey, mr. Simonet.

645
00:36:29,378 --> 00:36:30,762
Hello.

646
00:36:40,816 --> 00:36:42,867
Were you
just being nice?

647
00:36:42,903 --> 00:36:45,038
About what?

648
00:36:45,074 --> 00:36:47,993
About my idea.

649
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,582
Do you think it's good,
or were you just...

650
00:36:50,636 --> 00:36:51,886
Being teachery?

651
00:36:51,921 --> 00:36:54,389
Teachery?

652
00:36:54,426 --> 00:36:56,560
Bullshitting.

653
00:36:56,597 --> 00:37:00,966
Do I strike you
as someone falsely nice?

654
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:05,675
No. You're not even
really all that nice.

655
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:09,653
Well, it was a slip-up,

656
00:37:09,738 --> 00:37:12,774
And it will
not happen again.

657
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,954
What?

658
00:37:21,278 --> 00:37:23,279
What happened
to your face?

659
00:37:40,632 --> 00:37:43,433
Did you draw the short
straw today, trevor?

660
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,188
It's not
a very pertinent subject

661
00:37:46,276 --> 00:37:48,310
To social studies,
is it?

662
00:37:48,363 --> 00:37:50,447
You can go back and
tell them that's what I said.

663
00:37:50,484 --> 00:37:52,652
Tell who?

664
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:53,705
See you tomorrow.

665
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,206
Do you know
where jerry is?

666
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:22,458
Over there,
at the gate.

667
00:38:46,709 --> 00:38:47,992
[knock on door]

668
00:38:53,038 --> 00:38:54,421
[knocking]

669
00:38:54,507 --> 00:38:56,207
It's more product.

670
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,761
Man: Who is it?

671
00:38:57,846 --> 00:39:03,518
Trevor: It's trevor.
I'm looking for jerry.

672
00:39:03,557 --> 00:39:06,476
Jerry's not here.

673
00:39:06,563 --> 00:39:08,697
Trevor: When
will he be back?

674
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:13,237
Man: He's not coming back.
Now get outta here.

675
00:39:19,171 --> 00:39:20,221
Jerry?

676
00:39:20,256 --> 00:39:24,393
Man: Get outta here!

677
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:27,016
Please come out, jerry.

678
00:40:45,052 --> 00:40:47,721
I remember 1976.
There were those programs

679
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:51,160
In the school system.
Now it's--all that's gone.

680
00:40:51,214 --> 00:40:53,699
Man: I gotta go.

681
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:55,053
Trevor.

682
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:56,856
You ran out of class
this morning very fast.

683
00:40:56,908 --> 00:40:58,326
I wanted to talk to you.

684
00:41:17,816 --> 00:41:21,018
[school bell rings]

685
00:41:43,648 --> 00:41:45,065
[knock on door]

686
00:41:50,127 --> 00:41:51,944
Hello.

687
00:41:51,998 --> 00:41:53,048
Hello.

688
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:55,084
Come in.

689
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,768
Trevor's not feeling good.
He's in his room.

690
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,205
Oh, I'm sorry.
What's the matter?

691
00:42:06,258 --> 00:42:07,876
Just a tummyache.

692
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:09,346
Do you want to come in?

693
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:13,050
Sure.
[clears throat]

694
00:42:13,106 --> 00:42:16,858
Uh, sit down.
Thank you.

695
00:42:16,896 --> 00:42:18,313
It's a very
beautiful home.

696
00:42:18,399 --> 00:42:19,316
Thank you.

697
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:20,768
Have, uh,
you lived in vegas

698
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,654
Your whole life?
Yeah.

699
00:42:29,303 --> 00:42:30,787
I was surprised
you wanted to do this.

700
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,557
I told him if you
wanted to talk to me,

701
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:34,260
I would come
to the school.

702
00:42:34,312 --> 00:42:38,849
Mrs. Mckinney,
I didn't ask to see you.

703
00:42:38,939 --> 00:42:41,490
Well,
trevor said you did.

704
00:42:41,577 --> 00:42:45,580
Yeah, and he gave me
a note from you...

705
00:42:45,618 --> 00:42:48,152
Which you didn't write.

706
00:42:48,206 --> 00:42:50,624
He gave you
a note from me?

707
00:42:52,631 --> 00:42:55,165
Oh, god,
that's horrible.

708
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,304
He's been so--
no, I didn't mean you.

709
00:42:57,357 --> 00:42:58,758
Oh, no explanation
required. I'll go.

710
00:42:58,793 --> 00:42:59,760
I didn't mean you.

711
00:42:59,795 --> 00:43:00,929
No, you don't have to--

712
00:43:00,964 --> 00:43:03,849
Hey, it's not personal.
Would you stop?

713
00:43:03,937 --> 00:43:06,939
Can we just rewind here
a little bit?

714
00:43:06,976 --> 00:43:11,846
I obviously didn't realize
how much trevor likes you.

715
00:43:11,902 --> 00:43:14,453
Well, that's nothing
that we can't discuss

716
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:15,690
On parent-teacher night.

717
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:18,527
Then why did you come?

718
00:43:18,581 --> 00:43:20,882
Why did you come here?
Why didn't you just tell me

719
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:22,636
To come to the school?

720
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,713
Because you came
to the school

721
00:43:28,768 --> 00:43:30,352
To talk to me
about your son,

722
00:43:30,404 --> 00:43:33,606
And I behaved
like a...

723
00:43:33,693 --> 00:43:35,945
An asshole?

724
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:39,784
Sorry. Is that
too trailer trash

725
00:43:39,872 --> 00:43:40,872
A word for you?

726
00:43:40,924 --> 00:43:44,627
How does rat bastard
sit with you?

727
00:43:44,714 --> 00:43:46,131
That's pretty good.

728
00:43:46,218 --> 00:43:47,401
Dickhead?

729
00:43:47,453 --> 00:43:48,670
Oh, I like that.
[laughs]

730
00:43:52,045 --> 00:43:53,012
Look, I'm...

731
00:44:04,218 --> 00:44:10,257
I, um, I made
all this food.

732
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:12,632
It's just
sittin' here, um...

733
00:44:16,543 --> 00:44:20,429
I really don't know
who else to talk to about him.

734
00:44:20,517 --> 00:44:23,252
Mmm. This is good.

735
00:44:23,305 --> 00:44:24,723
Thanks.

736
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:26,559
I don't understand.
This is summer school?

737
00:44:26,628 --> 00:44:28,479
Uh-huh.

738
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:30,483
Why do you think
trevor stopped talking?

739
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:35,607
I don't know.
He seems mad.

740
00:44:35,697 --> 00:44:37,531
Well, seventh grade
is difficult,

741
00:44:37,566 --> 00:44:39,200
But he seems
very happy at school.

742
00:44:39,236 --> 00:44:43,490
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe it's fine.

743
00:44:43,578 --> 00:44:45,278
How much
do you see him?

744
00:44:45,332 --> 00:44:46,966
As much as I can.

745
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,135
How much is that?

746
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:51,622
No, I'm not doin'
a bunch of skanky guys

747
00:44:51,676 --> 00:44:53,594
Instead of spending time
with my son, ok?

748
00:44:53,647 --> 00:44:56,432
I got 2 jobs.

749
00:44:56,486 --> 00:45:00,689
Right. I meant that.

750
00:45:00,778 --> 00:45:04,114
Couldn't have just
been a question.

751
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:08,289
Uh, mrs. Mckinney,
do you think

752
00:45:08,342 --> 00:45:09,593
There might
be something,

753
00:45:09,628 --> 00:45:11,796
Um, I don't know,
outside of school

754
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:13,550
That might
be bothering him?

755
00:45:13,636 --> 00:45:17,139
I don't know.

756
00:45:18,963 --> 00:45:20,530
Ok, you know, I'm
gonna have to consult

757
00:45:20,616 --> 00:45:22,349
My spirit guides here,
because you tell me

758
00:45:22,403 --> 00:45:23,686
That trevor's
withholding from you,

759
00:45:23,738 --> 00:45:25,473
But you won't tell me
anything specific,

760
00:45:25,542 --> 00:45:26,742
And you still
want me to sit here

761
00:45:26,828 --> 00:45:27,878
And divine why.

762
00:45:27,963 --> 00:45:32,083
Divine why?
You always talk like that?

763
00:45:32,172 --> 00:45:33,122
Yes.

764
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:35,458
You go to some
big, fancy school?

765
00:45:35,528 --> 00:45:37,929
Yes.

766
00:45:38,016 --> 00:45:40,184
Think you could stop
rubbing my nose in it?

767
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:47,699
Is there a father?

768
00:45:47,751 --> 00:45:50,286
He doesn't
live here anymore.

769
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:52,424
I don't know
where he is.

770
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,428
Yeah. I know
what that's like.

771
00:45:54,514 --> 00:45:55,597
[knock on door]

772
00:45:55,684 --> 00:45:57,701
Bonnie: Arlene,
I've called you 5 times.

773
00:45:57,753 --> 00:45:59,037
Did you slip or what?

774
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,257
Bonnie.
No, listen,

775
00:46:00,342 --> 00:46:01,843
You don't call your sponsor
once in a while,

776
00:46:01,878 --> 00:46:02,845
You don't
have a sponsor.

777
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,080
Bonnie!
What?

778
00:46:04,132 --> 00:46:07,118
Arlene: This
is eugene simonet.

779
00:46:07,205 --> 00:46:09,623
You're not supposed
to date for a year.

780
00:46:09,711 --> 00:46:10,611
Arlene:
This isn't a date.

781
00:46:10,695 --> 00:46:11,895
No, I'm--I'm
trevor's teacher.

782
00:46:11,948 --> 00:46:12,898
It isn't. It's--

783
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:13,984
We're having
a conference,

784
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:16,887
And, uh, we were
through. We're done.

785
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,758
Arlene: We're done.

786
00:46:35,777 --> 00:46:37,561
[sighs]

787
00:46:37,614 --> 00:46:39,230
How could you
do that to me?

788
00:46:39,284 --> 00:46:41,986
Write a letter to him?
Sign my name?

789
00:46:42,022 --> 00:46:43,689
Why'd you have
to mess everything up?

790
00:46:43,742 --> 00:46:45,526
Oh, no.
I didn't mess this up.

791
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:46,529
What were you doing,

792
00:46:46,581 --> 00:46:47,531
Just standing
at the door

793
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:49,034
Listening to everything?

794
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:50,370
What happened
to your stomachache?

795
00:46:50,422 --> 00:46:52,039
What do you care?
You always lie.

796
00:46:52,092 --> 00:46:53,626
Trevor, this
wasn't my fault.

797
00:46:53,711 --> 00:46:55,045
This whole thing
was embarrassing.

798
00:46:55,098 --> 00:46:57,182
I did something good,
and you don't even know it.

799
00:46:57,218 --> 00:47:00,287
Honey, listen.

800
00:47:00,374 --> 00:47:02,074
You can't just put
2 people together

801
00:47:02,128 --> 00:47:03,077
And make 'em
like each other.

802
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,297
It doesn't work
that way.

803
00:47:04,382 --> 00:47:06,883
You only like people
you can get drunk with.

804
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:10,609
You're just waiting
for him to come back.

805
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:11,611
No, I'm not.

806
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:12,946
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.

807
00:47:13,032 --> 00:47:14,316
Yes, you are!
No, I'm not!

808
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:15,401
Your father's
not gettin'

809
00:47:15,453 --> 00:47:16,403
His foot
through--

810
00:47:16,455 --> 00:47:17,405
That's what
you always say.

811
00:47:17,457 --> 00:47:18,407
Well, I mean it now.

812
00:47:18,459 --> 00:47:19,492
You always mean it.

813
00:47:19,578 --> 00:47:20,795
What do you
want me to say?

814
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,564
I say it, I mean it.
I mean it now.

815
00:47:22,617 --> 00:47:23,817
Not when he's around.
When he's around,

816
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,953
You don't care
what happens to me.

817
00:47:25,038 --> 00:47:26,322
You don't ev--
you don't even know

818
00:47:26,407 --> 00:47:27,491
I'm in the same house.

819
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:28,494
That's not true.
It is true.

820
00:47:28,578 --> 00:47:29,661
You know--
it's true.

821
00:47:29,748 --> 00:47:31,632
Listen, I love you.

822
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:32,801
I love you.

823
00:47:32,886 --> 00:47:34,387
I'm doing
the best I can.

824
00:47:34,423 --> 00:47:35,757
I don't want you
to love me.

825
00:47:35,809 --> 00:47:37,476
I hate the way you look.
I hate the way you smell.

826
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,463
I hate the way you are.

827
00:47:38,548 --> 00:47:39,498
I hate that
you're my mother.

828
00:49:23,934 --> 00:49:26,018
Trev?

829
00:49:29,862 --> 00:49:31,646
Trev, I'm gonna
come in, ok?

830
00:49:42,085 --> 00:49:44,503
He said that an hour ago.

831
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:49,627
Do--do you understand
my kid is missing?

832
00:49:49,683 --> 00:49:53,436
If I had a car,
I'd be out looking for him!

833
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:58,480
[ring]

834
00:50:00,104 --> 00:50:01,854
[ring]

835
00:50:05,497 --> 00:50:07,699
What time do you
think he took off?

836
00:50:07,785 --> 00:50:11,487
I don't know.
I'm sorry to do this to you.

837
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:13,710
Bonnie wasn't home,
the cops wouldn't come...

838
00:50:13,796 --> 00:50:14,963
It's ok.

839
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:16,365
And I would have called
one of my friends,

840
00:50:16,452 --> 00:50:17,368
But my friends
are all drunks...

841
00:50:17,454 --> 00:50:19,788
It's ok.
And so am I.

842
00:50:19,841 --> 00:50:21,959
I'm a drunk, too.

843
00:50:25,585 --> 00:50:27,169
I believe some
people refer to that

844
00:50:27,256 --> 00:50:28,456
As "in recovery."

845
00:50:37,175 --> 00:50:39,793
Where you going?

846
00:51:05,245 --> 00:51:07,213
Hey. You got enough?

847
00:51:07,299 --> 00:51:09,667
You need
a ticket somewhere?

848
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,139
How much? Hmm?
Come with me.

849
00:51:12,175 --> 00:51:13,342
I'll get you there.

850
00:51:13,394 --> 00:51:15,762
I'll get you a ticket,
you son of a bitch.

851
00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:16,849
Honey, are you ok?

852
00:51:17,937 --> 00:51:20,522
Man: Oh! Aah!

853
00:51:38,075 --> 00:51:39,575
Trev, for the rest
of my life,

854
00:51:39,662 --> 00:51:41,395
I could never be as
sorry about anything

855
00:51:41,448 --> 00:51:43,415
As I am for
what I did to you.

856
00:51:51,968 --> 00:51:54,220
I didn't drink.

857
00:51:54,273 --> 00:51:56,691
I wanted to,
but I didn't.

858
00:52:05,962 --> 00:52:08,964
You got no reason
to trust me...

859
00:52:09,051 --> 00:52:10,669
And I know you
don't want to hear

860
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:13,139
Any more promises,

861
00:52:13,226 --> 00:52:15,811
So I'm just gonna
tell you the truth.

862
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:21,471
I have a problem.

863
00:52:21,525 --> 00:52:25,661
I have a really bad
problem.

864
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,168
I gotta stop.

865
00:52:31,043 --> 00:52:33,161
And if you can
be with me on this,

866
00:52:33,214 --> 00:52:36,166
If you can think
it's possible

867
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:39,005
That I can do it...

868
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:43,446
Then I think
maybe I can...

869
00:52:43,484 --> 00:52:45,702
If you just...

870
00:52:45,789 --> 00:52:49,375
Try a little bit,
and I'll try.

871
00:53:11,538 --> 00:53:12,922
Arlene:
You're still here.

872
00:53:13,008 --> 00:53:14,174
Oh, yeah.
I hope it's ok.

873
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:15,510
I just wanted
to make sure--

874
00:53:15,545 --> 00:53:17,446
He's asleep.
Good, ok.

875
00:53:17,533 --> 00:53:19,000
How did you know
where he was?

876
00:53:19,036 --> 00:53:21,755
Oh. Well, kids,
they either hitchhike,

877
00:53:21,841 --> 00:53:22,874
Or they take a bus.

878
00:53:22,926 --> 00:53:24,260
Listen, um--

879
00:53:24,345 --> 00:53:25,512
For what?

880
00:53:25,549 --> 00:53:28,050
Well, what?
Wait, give me a shot--

881
00:53:28,103 --> 00:53:29,721
No, you don't have to.
I--I understand--

882
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:31,690
Wait! God damn,
I want to thank you.

883
00:53:34,532 --> 00:53:35,899
Thank you.

884
00:53:35,951 --> 00:53:36,951
You're welcome.

885
00:53:37,037 --> 00:53:38,237
[laughs]

886
00:53:40,543 --> 00:53:41,994
Wasn't quite worth it,
was it?

887
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,547
No.

888
00:53:43,583 --> 00:53:44,716
Listen,
I was wondering,

889
00:53:44,752 --> 00:53:47,420
Do you want to come
back here sometime?

890
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,675
Have dinner with me?

891
00:53:53,603 --> 00:53:58,990
I'm not entirely sure
that would be appropriate.

892
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,315
Ok. I understand.

893
00:54:02,369 --> 00:54:04,921
Good night.
Good night.

894
00:54:15,812 --> 00:54:18,480
Ok. Why'd you do that man
the favor, sidney?

895
00:54:18,534 --> 00:54:21,686
No, it's, like,
3 favors, player.

896
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,524
You gotta do 3.

897
00:54:23,576 --> 00:54:24,543
Now I'll do
the other 2

898
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:26,296
Up in here
for my folks.

899
00:54:26,332 --> 00:54:27,299
You know,
a lot of brothers

900
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:28,301
Need favors in here.

901
00:54:28,336 --> 00:54:29,837
Who told you
to do it?

902
00:54:29,889 --> 00:54:34,008
[sighs]

903
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:36,682
It's, like,
this idea I got.

904
00:54:37,687 --> 00:54:39,571
Yo, you gonna
put this on tv?

905
00:54:39,657 --> 00:54:43,493
Wait. How did you come up
with an idea like that?

906
00:54:43,532 --> 00:54:46,233
Man, it's like...

907
00:54:46,287 --> 00:54:48,671
It's like the world
is a shit hole.

908
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:50,592
I mean, excuse my french
and shit, right?

909
00:54:50,678 --> 00:54:52,596
And it's like...

910
00:54:52,682 --> 00:54:55,083
I just thought,
like, boom!

911
00:54:55,137 --> 00:54:58,055
Like the whole shit
could be, like, better.

912
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:02,198
Didn't start
with anyone else?

913
00:55:02,234 --> 00:55:04,869
No, nigger. That shit
came from here, all right?

914
00:55:04,906 --> 00:55:06,456
The shit came from my head.

915
00:55:06,542 --> 00:55:07,743
I mean, I can't lie
to you, man,

916
00:55:07,795 --> 00:55:08,828
I-I've been through--

917
00:55:08,914 --> 00:55:12,950
Through some
heavy-ass shit...

918
00:55:13,005 --> 00:55:15,924
But not no more, I mean,
'cause it changed me...

919
00:55:15,978 --> 00:55:17,628
And I'm changing
this place, man.

920
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,599
I mean, people
are listening to me.

921
00:55:20,653 --> 00:55:24,522
People are staying clean.
[laughs]

922
00:55:24,611 --> 00:55:28,864
I mean--I mean, it's like
some cosmic aristotle shit.

923
00:55:28,953 --> 00:55:29,869
You feel me?

924
00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:31,822
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

925
00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:33,658
Yeah, no doubt.
I feel ya.

926
00:55:33,711 --> 00:55:35,996
No doubt, dog.
No doubt.

927
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:39,668
The thing is,
sidney, um...

928
00:55:39,723 --> 00:55:42,558
Somebody else is saying
that "pay it forward"

929
00:55:42,645 --> 00:55:44,496
Was their idea.

930
00:55:46,369 --> 00:55:47,403
Who?

931
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:52,912
I think you know who.

932
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:56,753
That bitch.

933
00:55:56,839 --> 00:55:59,007
No. No. She
a lyin'-ass bitch, man,

934
00:55:59,061 --> 00:56:00,144
I'm telling you.

935
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:01,880
She's a lyin' bitch.
She got your head.

936
00:56:01,932 --> 00:56:03,182
I'm telling you.
Ok.

937
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,551
Hey, she makes a pretty
good case, though, sid.

938
00:56:04,604 --> 00:56:06,322
That old
crusty bag lady?

939
00:56:06,357 --> 00:56:08,158
I'm telling you, man,
this is all from me,

940
00:56:08,194 --> 00:56:09,328
All from my heart, dog.

941
00:56:09,363 --> 00:56:10,730
Ok. She said--sidney.
What?

942
00:56:10,782 --> 00:56:11,916
Listen to me.
It doesn't matter

943
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,234
If you got it from
the old lady or not,

944
00:56:13,288 --> 00:56:14,237
'cause you're the one
paying it forward.

945
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:15,239
You damn right.

946
00:56:15,292 --> 00:56:16,425
In prison, no less.

947
00:56:16,511 --> 00:56:19,296
The parole board
will eat that up, sidney.

948
00:56:19,382 --> 00:56:20,516
Oh, the parole board?

949
00:56:20,551 --> 00:56:22,085
The parole board.

950
00:56:22,138 --> 00:56:26,641
[laughs] oh, snap, yo.
You good, man.

951
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:29,198
Like a little carrot
for the mouse and shit.

952
00:56:29,234 --> 00:56:31,986
[laughs]
no doubt, no doubt.

953
00:56:32,074 --> 00:56:33,074
It's too bad
my parole

954
00:56:33,126 --> 00:56:34,292
Don't come up for
another year, b.

955
00:56:34,378 --> 00:56:35,378
[pounds table with fist]

956
00:56:37,734 --> 00:56:39,435
What if I could make it

957
00:56:39,488 --> 00:56:41,539
So your parole
comes up next month?

958
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,476
Arlene: Hello.

959
00:58:02,615 --> 00:58:05,700
Oh. Hello.

960
00:58:05,787 --> 00:58:08,539
Did you know
I worked here?

961
00:58:08,626 --> 00:58:12,161
No, I didn't.
Really.

962
00:58:12,216 --> 00:58:16,420
So you just dropped in
for a little game of craps?

963
00:58:16,508 --> 00:58:21,729
No. I, uh, I like
the coffee shop.

964
00:58:21,818 --> 00:58:25,271
They--they
have good food.

965
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:28,894
Yeah. They got
good pancakes.

966
00:58:28,948 --> 00:58:33,535
Yeah. Fluffy.

967
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:35,341
Do you want me

968
00:58:35,377 --> 00:58:37,011
To bring you
back something?

969
00:58:37,048 --> 00:58:39,766
Oh, no, thanks.
I get off in an hour.

970
00:58:39,852 --> 00:58:41,887
Oh, really?

971
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,024
Yeah, really.

972
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:47,365
Well--

973
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,202
Well, if you were
gonna eat anyway,

974
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,623
Then,

975
00:58:51,709 --> 00:58:55,628
If you, if you
wanted, maybe,

976
00:58:55,717 --> 00:58:59,803
If you were
hungry, we could--

977
00:58:59,891 --> 00:59:01,676
We could, if you,
if you were,

978
00:59:01,761 --> 00:59:03,729
If you wanted...

979
00:59:05,602 --> 00:59:10,906
Eat something...
Sometime.

980
00:59:15,121 --> 00:59:16,955
7-iron, please.

981
00:59:17,008 --> 00:59:18,625
Yes, sir.

982
00:59:30,283 --> 00:59:31,617
Can I help you?

983
00:59:32,788 --> 00:59:35,489
No, I am not stalking
the governor, jordy.

984
00:59:35,543 --> 00:59:38,128
Shit. Chandler.

985
00:59:38,181 --> 00:59:40,482
You scared me.

986
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:42,203
You look like crap.
What are you doing out here?

987
00:59:42,289 --> 00:59:43,373
I want to talk
to him, jordan.

988
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:45,042
Heh! Your questions
piss him off.

989
00:59:45,129 --> 00:59:46,212
Oh, is that why
I got the bounce?

990
00:59:46,297 --> 00:59:47,214
He won't talk to you.

991
00:59:47,299 --> 00:59:48,216
Well, tell him
I'm a candygram.

992
00:59:48,301 --> 00:59:49,385
Stop it.

993
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:50,554
I got a better idea.
Why don't I tell him

994
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:51,889
I've been sitting on
a story for 2 years

995
00:59:51,975 --> 00:59:53,058
About a little
party he had.

996
00:59:53,144 --> 00:59:54,978
The cleanup crew
found syringes,

997
00:59:55,031 --> 00:59:56,615
Si 12 1/2
high heels,

998
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:57,683
Animal droppings.

999
00:59:57,735 --> 00:59:59,236
That can't
be right, can it?

1000
00:59:59,322 --> 01:00:01,574
[laughs] if you
really had this,

1001
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:02,577
You'd have used it.

1002
01:00:02,662 --> 01:00:03,796
Bullshit.

1003
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:05,031
His friends in high
places had me kill it,

1004
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:06,250
But ever since
I got fired,

1005
01:00:06,335 --> 01:00:08,003
I'm really not feeling
that loyal, you know?

1006
01:00:09,341 --> 01:00:10,425
What do you want?

1007
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:11,594
$4 million.

1008
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:13,430
[scoffs]

1009
01:00:13,516 --> 01:00:15,851
I'm kidding, man.
Relax.

1010
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:16,937
Ha ha ha!

1011
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,440
Nothing, man.
A phone call.

1012
01:00:18,525 --> 01:00:19,525
I just need
a little phone call.

1013
01:00:19,577 --> 01:00:20,777
I need a massage

1014
01:00:20,864 --> 01:00:22,448
For a friend of
mine's parole date.

1015
01:00:22,533 --> 01:00:23,500
That's it.

1016
01:00:28,695 --> 01:00:30,947
God, trevor.
They kept me 40 minutes over.

1017
01:00:31,033 --> 01:00:32,400
Did you call him?

1018
01:00:32,452 --> 01:00:33,619
I couldn't remember the name
of the stupid restaurant.

1019
01:00:33,704 --> 01:00:34,621
I remember the name
of the hotel.

1020
01:00:34,706 --> 01:00:35,623
I couldn't remember the n--

1021
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:36,708
He hates people
being late.

1022
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,627
If you're late,
he thinks it means

1023
01:00:37,712 --> 01:00:38,963
You don't
respect him.

1024
01:00:39,048 --> 01:00:40,015
What?

1025
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:41,467
If you're late,
he'll think

1026
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,471
It means you
don't respect him.

1027
01:00:51,556 --> 01:00:52,589
Well, I don't know.
Are you wearing this?

1028
01:00:52,641 --> 01:00:53,758
No. I want to wear
the green dress.

1029
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,361
You look like
a vampire in that.

1030
01:00:55,397 --> 01:00:57,264
Uhh. I gotta
take a shower.

1031
01:00:57,317 --> 01:00:58,266
What?

1032
01:00:58,319 --> 01:00:59,435
I smell horrible.

1033
01:00:59,487 --> 01:01:01,372
No, you don't.
No, you smell good.

1034
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:02,875
You smell like, uh,
roses or something.

1035
01:01:02,911 --> 01:01:03,877
Let me just wash

1036
01:01:03,913 --> 01:01:05,046
Under my arms
really quick.

1037
01:01:05,082 --> 01:01:06,049
Are you sure?

1038
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:07,250
Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure.

1039
01:01:16,771 --> 01:01:18,989
Trevor: Oh, wait.
Don't interrupt him

1040
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:19,992
When he's in the middle
of a sentence.

1041
01:01:20,077 --> 01:01:21,160
He doesn't
like that, either.

1042
01:01:21,246 --> 01:01:22,746
What am I supposed to do,
raise my hand?

1043
01:01:22,783 --> 01:01:23,916
Get me my shoes, ok?
No.

1044
01:01:23,952 --> 01:01:24,918
Those little sandals.

1045
01:01:24,954 --> 01:01:25,987
These.

1046
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:26,922
No, no, no.
I'm not wearing those.

1047
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:27,924
They're way too sexy.

1048
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,427
You're too late.
You owe him.

1049
01:01:29,462 --> 01:01:32,681
I owe him?
Who are you?

1050
01:01:34,305 --> 01:01:36,890
Oh, and none of
those stupid jokes.

1051
01:01:36,977 --> 01:01:38,277
He's not that kind
of person, ok?

1052
01:01:38,312 --> 01:01:39,279
Thank you
very much.

1053
01:01:39,314 --> 01:01:40,281
Where's
the phone?

1054
01:01:40,316 --> 01:01:41,683
I gotta call
for a cab.

1055
01:01:41,735 --> 01:01:42,685
If I take a bus,

1056
01:01:42,737 --> 01:01:43,687
It might be
another hour,

1057
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:44,689
And I'm late.
No. Mom. Mom.

1058
01:01:44,741 --> 01:01:46,325
I got a call in
to the cabbie.

1059
01:01:46,395 --> 01:01:47,945
I gotta call for a cab.

1060
01:01:47,981 --> 01:01:50,265
Duh.

1061
01:01:50,302 --> 01:01:51,969
Oh, my god.

1062
01:01:52,974 --> 01:01:55,192
Oh, my god.
You're a champ.

1063
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:56,195
Ok. Ok, mom.

1064
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,364
You're
the greatest kid on--

1065
01:01:57,449 --> 01:01:59,033
Ok, mom. Ok, mom. Ok.

1066
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,486
You have to go.

01:11:07,123 --> 01:11:08,089
Something that
clears a check.

1244
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:09,091
You know?

1245
01:11:09,127 --> 01:11:11,327
Are you sure that's all?

1246
01:11:11,381 --> 01:11:14,967
Look. Ok. I, uh, I drank
the last of the coffee.

1247
01:11:15,022 --> 01:11:16,222
Please put it
on the list.

1248
01:11:16,307 --> 01:11:17,424
Huh.

1249
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:19,627
[kisses]

1250
01:11:20,682 --> 01:11:22,133
Bye.

1251
01:11:25,893 --> 01:11:26,809
[music playing]

1252
01:11:26,895 --> 01:11:29,062
â™ª if some miracle â™ª

1253
01:11:29,149 --> 01:11:32,952
â™ª could win your love
for me â™ª

1254
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:36,992
â™ª whoa, little girl â™ª

1255
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:40,800
â™ª how happy I would be â™ª

1256
01:11:40,837 --> 01:11:42,304
[knock on door]

1257
01:11:42,341 --> 01:11:44,142
â™ª if some miracle could
win your love for me â™ª

1258
01:11:44,177 --> 01:11:45,144
[knocks]

1259
01:11:45,179 --> 01:11:46,146
Who's there?

1260
01:11:46,181 --> 01:11:47,148
â™ª win your love â™ª

1261
01:11:47,183 --> 01:11:48,150
â™ª your love for me â™ª

1262
01:11:48,185 --> 01:11:49,152
Hey.

1263
01:11:49,187 --> 01:11:50,154
Hey.

1264
01:11:50,189 --> 01:11:51,156
Do you
look down on me?

1265
01:11:51,191 --> 01:11:52,158
What?

1266
01:11:52,193 --> 01:11:53,326
Do you
look down on me?

1267
01:11:53,362 --> 01:11:54,328
No.

1268
01:11:54,364 --> 01:11:55,397
'cause I don't
talk like you.

1269
01:11:55,449 --> 01:11:57,000
I haven't read
the stuff you read.

1270
01:11:57,035 --> 01:11:58,118
What are you
talking about?

1271
01:11:58,204 --> 01:11:59,421
That's not pertinent,
and you know it.

1272
01:11:59,507 --> 01:12:02,092
Don't talk to me
like that.

1273
01:12:02,179 --> 01:12:05,097
I'm sorry, but that's
the way I talk, you know.

1274
01:12:05,185 --> 01:12:06,602
Words are all I have.

1275
01:12:06,687 --> 01:12:08,104
Why? Why?

1276
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,608
'cause you think
you look like shit?

1277
01:12:09,693 --> 01:12:10,759
Is that it?

1278
01:12:10,812 --> 01:12:13,280
I don't care about
your burns, eugene,

1279
01:12:13,366 --> 01:12:14,283
If that's
even what they are.

1280
01:12:14,368 --> 01:12:16,119
Is that
what they are?

1281
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:17,206
Yes.

1282
01:12:17,241 --> 01:12:18,791
Ok. Well, whatever
happened to you,

1283
01:12:18,878 --> 01:12:21,463
You look good to me.

1284
01:12:25,724 --> 01:12:27,141
You look good
to me, too.

1285
01:12:27,227 --> 01:12:29,394
Ok. So?

1286
01:12:30,901 --> 01:12:35,154
So I've never
been here before.

1287
01:12:35,243 --> 01:12:37,661
Ok.
So you're scared.

1288
01:12:37,747 --> 01:12:38,664
I'm scared, too.

1289
01:12:38,749 --> 01:12:40,166
Listen.

1290
01:12:40,252 --> 01:12:41,835
Bad things have
happened to me, ok?

1291
01:12:41,922 --> 01:12:43,506
I can't take
my shirt off with a guy

1292
01:12:43,591 --> 01:12:45,292
Without 5 beers in me,

1293
01:12:45,345 --> 01:12:47,012
But I want that
with you.

1294
01:12:47,099 --> 01:12:50,801
More than I'm scared,
I want that.

1295
01:12:50,889 --> 01:12:53,607
â™ª win your love for me â™ª

1296
01:12:53,645 --> 01:12:54,611
â™ª for me â™ª

1297
01:12:54,647 --> 01:12:55,647
â™ª whoa â™ª

1298
01:12:55,732 --> 01:12:57,199
â™ª whoa â™ª
â™ª whoa â™ª

1299
01:12:57,285 --> 01:12:58,568
[music stops]

1300
01:13:03,997 --> 01:13:05,881
You don't see me.

1301
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,672
All right, my life--

1302
01:13:13,899 --> 01:13:15,650
My life is familiar,

1303
01:13:15,687 --> 01:13:17,571
My life is--

1304
01:13:17,657 --> 01:13:19,191
It's manageable.

1305
01:13:19,243 --> 01:13:20,393
It's manageable.

1306
01:13:20,446 --> 01:13:22,581
Every day...

1307
01:13:22,667 --> 01:13:25,202
I have a thing
I do every day.

1308
01:13:25,255 --> 01:13:27,206
It's all
I've ever known.

1309
01:13:27,259 --> 01:13:29,076
And...
It's a routine,

1310
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:30,263
And as long
as I have that--

1311
01:13:30,349 --> 01:13:32,600
As long
as I have that--

1312
01:13:32,686 --> 01:13:34,420
I'm ok, I'm ok.

1313
01:13:34,472 --> 01:13:35,689
If I don't have it,
I'm lost.

1314
01:13:35,726 --> 01:13:37,426
So is that
all you want?

1315
01:13:37,478 --> 01:13:39,780
Your god damn
manageable day?

1316
01:13:39,866 --> 01:13:40,866
It's what I have.

1317
01:13:40,901 --> 01:13:43,236
No, it isn't.
Is it what you want?

1318
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:44,707
Yes!
It's what I want!

1319
01:13:44,743 --> 01:13:46,410
I don't believe you.

1320
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:53,156
Ok. That's
the best I got.

1321
01:13:53,242 --> 01:13:54,159
It's not about you--

1322
01:13:54,244 --> 01:13:55,277
Yes, it is!

1323
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:57,414
Something's been
offered to you here,

1324
01:13:57,467 --> 01:13:59,118
And you
don't want it.

1325
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:00,887
Maybe you're scared
to get rejected.

1326
01:14:00,924 --> 01:14:02,091
Well, I can't
reject you.

1327
01:14:02,143 --> 01:14:03,560
You're too quick
for me!

1328
01:14:07,069 --> 01:14:08,103
[door slams]

1329
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:29,425
Hey.

1330
01:14:29,462 --> 01:14:31,846
You didn't call me
a fag, did you?

1331
01:14:36,107 --> 01:14:38,309
Hey, look
what I found!

1332
01:14:38,396 --> 01:14:39,462
What do you want?!
Give me that!

1333
01:14:39,515 --> 01:14:40,849
It's
my asthma spray!

1334
01:14:40,934 --> 01:14:41,834
Shut up!

1335
01:14:41,903 --> 01:14:43,453
Adam: Stop it!

1336
01:14:43,505 --> 01:14:44,572
Stay still!

1337
01:14:44,624 --> 01:14:45,574
Stop! Help me!

1338
01:14:45,626 --> 01:14:46,576
Hold still!

1339
01:14:46,628 --> 01:14:48,295
Hey!

1340
01:14:51,136 --> 01:14:53,254
Hey, mckinney.

1341
01:14:53,307 --> 01:14:54,257
Come here.

1342
01:14:54,309 --> 01:14:56,427
Boy: Yeah,
let's hang out.

1343
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:00,132
Help me. Please.

1344
01:15:00,188 --> 01:15:01,788
Screw it.
He's not doing anything.

1345
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,907
Come on.

1346
01:15:02,959 --> 01:15:05,244
Let me go!
Let me go!

1347
01:15:22,681 --> 01:15:24,048
Trevor...

1348
01:15:25,553 --> 01:15:27,437
You cut my class.

1349
01:15:29,394 --> 01:15:31,195
It's been 4 days.

1350
01:15:32,817 --> 01:15:35,285
What's been 4 days?

1351
01:15:35,372 --> 01:15:36,438
Why haven't you
called my mother?

1352
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,291
It's been 4 days.

1353
01:15:46,259 --> 01:15:48,010
I don't know.

1354
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:52,435
Neither does she.

1355
01:16:00,453 --> 01:16:02,204
Hey,
what's the matter?

1356
01:16:07,684 --> 01:16:10,769
Pay it forward
didn't work.

1357
01:16:10,807 --> 01:16:12,774
I couldn't
even do it.

1358
01:16:18,038 --> 01:16:19,988
I was gonna
help adam.

1359
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,719
Help adam do what?

1360
01:16:27,806 --> 01:16:29,424
Not get beat up.

1361
01:16:30,644 --> 01:16:32,979
But I crapped out,
and I let him.

1362
01:16:36,823 --> 01:16:38,607
I let him get beat.

1363
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:41,914
No, you didn't.
You didn't let him get beat.

1364
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,035
It just--it--
it happens, you know?

1365
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:47,841
Trevor, sometimes
there's nothing we can do.

1366
01:16:49,515 --> 01:16:50,848
It's not fair.

1367
01:16:50,884 --> 01:16:52,885
I know--
no!

1368
01:16:52,938 --> 01:16:55,022
You don't know.

1369
01:16:56,361 --> 01:16:58,061
You should call
my mother.

1370
01:16:58,115 --> 01:16:59,097
You could do
something

1371
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:01,234
If you wanted.

1372
01:17:01,287 --> 01:17:03,305
Why are you
so chicken?

1373
01:17:03,391 --> 01:17:04,592
Trevor, I'm not chicken--

1374
01:17:04,677 --> 01:17:05,594
Something's
gonna happen.

1375
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:07,430
Then it'll
be too late.

1376
01:17:10,939 --> 01:17:13,057
What's gonna happen?
What do you mean?

1377
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:16,781
He'll come back.

1378
01:17:18,788 --> 01:17:21,105
Who will come back?

1379
01:17:21,159 --> 01:17:22,909
Hey, who will come--

1380
01:17:28,907 --> 01:17:30,724
Your dad.

1381
01:17:35,737 --> 01:17:37,738
Your dad will come back?

1382
01:17:40,329 --> 01:17:42,113
And...

1383
01:17:44,203 --> 01:17:45,203
What will happen

1384
01:17:45,288 --> 01:17:47,589
When he comes back,
trevor?

1385
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:53,017
Will he hurt you?

1386
01:17:58,981 --> 01:18:00,815
Will he hurt her?

1387
01:18:07,581 --> 01:18:09,749
Not if
someone's there...

1388
01:18:11,506 --> 01:18:13,390
Instead of him.

1389
01:18:16,582 --> 01:18:18,332
[whispering] trevor...

1390
01:18:22,226 --> 01:18:24,061
Trevor, it's--

1391
01:18:24,146 --> 01:18:27,131
It's complicated
for me now. I...

1392
01:18:30,943 --> 01:18:33,361
Is the world
just shit?

1393
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:38,622
No, it isn't.

1394
01:18:40,294 --> 01:18:42,445
Hey.

1395
01:18:42,531 --> 01:18:44,399
You did good work.

1396
01:18:44,452 --> 01:18:47,120
Look at me.
I'm proud of you, trevor.

1397
01:18:47,208 --> 01:18:49,175
I'm proud of you.

1398
01:18:52,802 --> 01:18:55,887
And anyway,
for what it's worth,

1399
01:18:55,941 --> 01:18:57,091
I'm grading you
on the effort,

1400
01:18:57,143 --> 01:18:58,894
Not the result.

1401
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,907
I don't care
about the grade.

1402
01:19:20,104 --> 01:19:21,271
I just wanted to see

1403
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:23,524
If the world
would really change.

1404
01:19:51,664 --> 01:19:53,665
[knock on door]

1405
01:20:01,483 --> 01:20:03,551
Hi.

1406
01:20:03,604 --> 01:20:05,688
Hi.

1407
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,696
Uh, come in.

1408
01:22:08,261 --> 01:22:10,346
Ohh! Trevor!

1409
01:22:10,382 --> 01:22:11,382
It worked!

1410
01:22:11,434 --> 01:22:13,168
Oh, god!

1411
01:22:15,207 --> 01:22:17,008
Eugene: Does he always
get up this early?

1412
01:22:17,045 --> 01:22:18,045
What?

1413
01:22:18,097 --> 01:22:19,413
Oh, my god,
this is not good.

1414
01:22:19,466 --> 01:22:20,415
He just saw me!

1415
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:21,968
It's ok!

1416
01:22:22,054 --> 01:22:23,854
Now you have to
pay it forward, too!

1417
01:22:23,891 --> 01:22:25,258
Trevor: Eugene?

1418
01:22:25,343 --> 01:22:26,293
I think you should

1419
01:22:26,379 --> 01:22:28,413
Still call me
mr. Simonet.

1420
01:22:28,466 --> 01:22:29,416
You had a sleepover,
didn't you?

1421
01:22:29,468 --> 01:22:30,418
Why don't you
go back to bed?

1422
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:31,437
Why?

1423
01:22:31,522 --> 01:22:32,588
It's too early
for you to be up--

1424
01:22:32,641 --> 01:22:33,891
No, it's not early!
No, it's a Sunday!

1425
01:22:33,943 --> 01:22:34,893
It's a Sunday?

1426
01:22:34,945 --> 01:22:36,112
Yeah.

1427
01:22:36,197 --> 01:22:37,231
So stay, stay!

1428
01:22:37,283 --> 01:22:38,233
You don't
understand,

1429
01:22:38,285 --> 01:22:39,235
I have
a whole schedule

1430
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:40,370
That you don't
know about.

1431
01:22:40,406 --> 01:22:41,939
All right, well,
bring everything here!

1432
01:22:41,992 --> 01:22:43,410
Would you please
take care of him?

1433
01:22:43,462 --> 01:22:45,112
I'll call you later,
all right?

1434
01:22:45,165 --> 01:22:46,132
Don't be a stranger!

1435
01:22:46,217 --> 01:22:47,251
God, trevor!

1436
01:22:47,303 --> 01:22:48,586
Trevor: Do you like him?

1437
01:23:25,192 --> 01:23:26,643
Ok.

1438
01:24:02,196 --> 01:24:05,115
[woman sobbing]

1439
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:13,231
Hey! Hey, hey!

1440
01:24:13,284 --> 01:24:14,735
Lady, come on.

1441
01:24:14,821 --> 01:24:16,221
Go away.

1442
01:24:16,274 --> 01:24:18,875
I-I'm not
gonna hurt you, lady.

1443
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:20,295
Oh, here, take it!

1444
01:24:20,332 --> 01:24:21,332
Well, it's
a nice thought,

1445
01:24:21,384 --> 01:24:22,717
But it's not
what I want.

1446
01:24:22,803 --> 01:24:24,754
What--what--

1447
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,374
Hey, what
are you doing?

1448
01:24:26,426 --> 01:24:28,877
I'm not
gonna hurt you!

1449
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:31,183
What are you--hey!

1450
01:24:31,236 --> 01:24:34,238
Oh, my god!
Listen to me.

1451
01:24:34,325 --> 01:24:35,275
Nothing's
this important!

1452
01:24:35,361 --> 01:24:37,578
Come on, come--
come down here!

1453
01:24:37,665 --> 01:24:39,065
What are you doing?

1454
01:24:39,117 --> 01:24:41,402
Woman: What do
you care, anyway?

1455
01:24:41,488 --> 01:24:42,789
Because I owe
somebody a favor.

1456
01:24:42,858 --> 01:24:44,776
Not me.

1457
01:24:44,861 --> 01:24:46,362
Why not you?

1458
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:47,782
You know--heh!

1459
01:24:47,867 --> 01:24:49,335
A minute ago,

1460
01:24:49,371 --> 01:24:50,788
All I could
think about

1461
01:24:50,873 --> 01:24:53,442
Was getting
my next fix,

1462
01:24:53,528 --> 01:24:56,580
And then I saw you,
a-and...

1463
01:24:56,668 --> 01:24:58,035
I changed
my thinking.

1464
01:24:58,088 --> 01:24:59,371
Oh, please!

1465
01:24:59,423 --> 01:25:00,707
Go away!

1466
01:25:00,759 --> 01:25:02,793
Trust me,
I'm not worth it.

1467
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,881
Why's that?

1468
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:06,184
Oh, for god's sake!

1469
01:25:06,219 --> 01:25:07,219
Come on, tell me!

1470
01:25:07,271 --> 01:25:09,723
Why are you
not worth it?

1471
01:25:09,776 --> 01:25:12,194
Trust me...

1472
01:25:12,231 --> 01:25:14,432
You wouldn't understand.

1473
01:25:14,486 --> 01:25:16,320
Are you kidding me?

1474
01:25:16,406 --> 01:25:18,491
You think
I live at the ritz?

1475
01:25:22,184 --> 01:25:25,002
Have a cup of coffee
with me?

1476
01:25:26,542 --> 01:25:28,376
What?

1477
01:25:35,592 --> 01:25:37,960
Do me a favor.

1478
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:41,685
Save my life.

1479
01:25:48,534 --> 01:25:50,051
[shouting]

1480
01:25:50,104 --> 01:25:51,054
Get him! Get him!

1481
01:25:51,106 --> 01:25:52,389
Off the ropes!
Off the ropes!

1482
01:25:52,442 --> 01:25:54,009
Oh, he missed him.

1483
01:25:54,061 --> 01:25:56,479
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, he did!

1484
01:25:56,517 --> 01:25:57,867
Bam-ba-bam-ba-bam-ba-bam!

1485
01:25:57,919 --> 01:26:00,654
Oh, oh, come on,
bleed, dude.

1486
01:26:00,708 --> 01:26:01,858
Announcer: Distraction
from the imperial...

1487
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:03,027
Oh, he's got him.
Give the ddt!

1488
01:26:03,079 --> 01:26:04,663
What?

1489
01:26:04,715 --> 01:26:05,799
It's gonna
be a ddt.

1490
01:26:05,834 --> 01:26:07,251
Up he goes,
and drop him on his head!

1491
01:26:08,656 --> 01:26:11,458
Oh, he's dead.
He's dead.

1492
01:26:11,496 --> 01:26:13,012
Ok, fearless,
get out of the ring.

1493
01:26:13,048 --> 01:26:14,015
What do you mean,
get out of the ring?

1494
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:15,100
You can't get
out of t ring.

1495
01:26:15,135 --> 01:26:16,335
Yes, he can.
He has to get a chair.

1496
01:26:16,388 --> 01:26:17,671
A chair?

1497
01:26:17,723 --> 01:26:19,340
[whispering]

1498
01:26:19,394 --> 01:26:20,444
Bam!

1499
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:22,130
Aah!

1500
01:26:22,182 --> 01:26:23,182
Slow motion.

1501
01:26:26,608 --> 01:26:27,942
Hyah!

1502
01:26:27,994 --> 01:26:30,628
Trevor, when did you
become so violent?

1503
01:26:30,682 --> 01:26:33,050
Oh, no, no, no.
Take me to a match.

1504
01:26:33,086 --> 01:26:34,470
You get splattered
in the front row.

1505
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:35,890
I don't want to be
splattered, thank you--

1506
01:26:35,925 --> 01:26:37,976
Yes, you do.
It'll be, like,

1507
01:26:38,063 --> 01:26:39,396
Your birthday
present to me.

1508
01:26:39,432 --> 01:26:40,599
Oh, no. You know what you're
getting for your birthday?

1509
01:26:40,651 --> 01:26:41,601
What?

1510
01:26:41,653 --> 01:26:42,969
A brand-new encyclopedia...

1511
01:26:43,023 --> 01:26:44,156
Oh, ohh.

1512
01:26:44,242 --> 01:26:45,559
Leather-bound...

1513
01:26:45,594 --> 01:26:48,629
Thucydides' history
of the peloponnesian war.

1514
01:26:48,683 --> 01:26:51,235
No, I'm getting you
51 crackling volumes.

1515
01:26:51,271 --> 01:26:54,156
There'll be
pop quizzes every day

1516
01:26:54,244 --> 01:26:56,245
On the development
of cotton farms--

1517
01:26:56,281 --> 01:26:57,248
Hi, arlene.

1518
01:26:57,283 --> 01:26:58,750
Unh!

1519
01:27:43,789 --> 01:27:46,174
You can't
stay here, ricky.

1520
01:27:46,227 --> 01:27:48,145
I know.

1521
01:27:48,198 --> 01:27:49,815
Look, I know
what we had

1522
01:27:49,867 --> 01:27:51,618
Was a nightmare,
arlene,

1523
01:27:51,654 --> 01:27:53,855
But I did it.

1524
01:27:53,908 --> 01:27:55,192
You did what?

1525
01:27:55,244 --> 01:27:56,878
I knew I
couldn't come back

1526
01:27:56,964 --> 01:27:59,833
To this house
unless I was sober.

1527
01:28:01,256 --> 01:28:03,540
It's the truth.

1528
01:28:03,594 --> 01:28:06,763
5 months,
2 weeks, and 4 days

1529
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:08,267
Of the truth.

1530
01:28:08,353 --> 01:28:09,654
[clears throat]

1531
01:28:09,689 --> 01:28:10,773
Where you been?

1532
01:28:10,858 --> 01:28:12,242
What does it
matter?

1533
01:28:12,327 --> 01:28:14,245
I knew
I had to change.

1534
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:16,282
Are you sober?

1535
01:28:16,368 --> 01:28:19,737
Yeah, and I got sober
staying right here.

1536
01:28:19,792 --> 01:28:21,575
Well, you're
stronger than me.

1537
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:23,763
Can you just stop
for a minute...

1538
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:25,684
Please?

1539
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:28,388
Can we just
sit down and talk?

1540
01:28:30,395 --> 01:28:31,395
Ok.

1541
01:28:39,797 --> 01:28:40,747
[sighs]

1542
01:28:45,675 --> 01:28:46,675
[sighs]

1543
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:50,432
[sighs]

1544
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:47,859
Hi.

1545
01:29:47,912 --> 01:29:48,861
God!

1546
01:29:48,914 --> 01:29:50,698
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1547
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:52,083
What are you
doing here?

1548
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:53,470
I want you
to understand--

1549
01:29:53,505 --> 01:29:54,806
Oh, it's not
necessary, really.

1550
01:29:54,841 --> 01:29:56,008
No explanation
required.

1551
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:58,428
Please don't talk
to me like that.

1552
01:29:58,514 --> 01:30:01,483
We had 13 years in,
eugene.

1553
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:02,604
He's sober now.

1554
01:30:02,689 --> 01:30:04,023
We've never been
sober together.

1555
01:30:04,076 --> 01:30:05,159
Well,
I wish you luck.

1556
01:30:05,195 --> 01:30:08,280
I feel like I gotta
give him a chance.

1557
01:30:08,368 --> 01:30:09,785
A chance?

1558
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:10,920
A chance
for what?

1559
01:30:11,006 --> 01:30:13,257
To change,

1560
01:30:13,343 --> 01:30:15,744
To try to make up
for lost time.

1561
01:30:15,798 --> 01:30:18,082
Oh, what, to take trevor
to some ball games?

1562
01:30:18,136 --> 01:30:19,603
Do some real daddy
things with him?

1563
01:30:19,689 --> 01:30:20,605
Yeah.

1564
01:30:20,691 --> 01:30:22,358
He promised
to try.

1565
01:30:22,395 --> 01:30:23,361
What do you
want me to do?

1566
01:30:23,396 --> 01:30:24,762
Oh, I don't know,
be smart.

1567
01:30:24,799 --> 01:30:25,882
He's his father,
eugene.

1568
01:30:25,934 --> 01:30:27,602
He impregnated you,
arlene.

1569
01:30:27,687 --> 01:30:30,222
In what other way has he
been a father to trevor?

1570
01:30:30,276 --> 01:30:33,362
Unless knocking somebody
around is a new family value.

1571
01:30:33,399 --> 01:30:34,649
What are you
talking about?

1572
01:30:34,735 --> 01:30:36,035
He never
touched trevor.

1573
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:37,937
Oh, that's right.

1574
01:30:37,991 --> 01:30:39,675
Only you.

1575
01:30:39,745 --> 01:30:41,445
He only took it
out on you.

1576
01:30:41,514 --> 01:30:43,131
That's so much better.

1577
01:30:46,391 --> 01:30:48,124
What did trevor
tell you?

1578
01:30:48,177 --> 01:30:49,927
Enough.

1579
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:52,565
Christ, arlene. Secrets
like that shouldn't be kept.

1580
01:30:52,602 --> 01:30:54,102
What good
does it do trevor?

1581
01:30:54,155 --> 01:30:56,273
You weren't there.
Ricky never meant to hit me.

1582
01:30:56,326 --> 01:30:57,410
We were drunk--

1583
01:30:57,445 --> 01:30:59,846
Christ! What is it
with women like you?

1584
01:30:59,933 --> 01:31:01,183
Is that something you
really tell yourself?

1585
01:31:01,268 --> 01:31:03,937
"oh, it's ok he beat me.
Trevor's ok"?

1586
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:06,275
Trevor has locked
himself in a bathroom,

1587
01:31:06,328 --> 01:31:07,746
And he can't breathe,

1588
01:31:07,782 --> 01:31:09,499
And he's--and he's
hoping and praying

1589
01:31:09,585 --> 01:31:10,501
That it will stop.

1590
01:31:10,587 --> 01:31:11,670
Trevor never
went through--

1591
01:31:11,756 --> 01:31:13,706
How do you know what
trevor went through?

1592
01:31:13,793 --> 01:31:15,594
How do you know?

1593
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:17,664
How do you know that
next time after you,

1594
01:31:17,717 --> 01:31:19,552
He doesn't
come for trevor?

1595
01:31:19,637 --> 01:31:22,055
I know what I'm
talking about, arlene.

1596
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:24,727
My father
got on his knees

1597
01:31:24,814 --> 01:31:26,198
And begged
my mother,

1598
01:31:26,284 --> 01:31:27,350
And my mother,

1599
01:31:27,403 --> 01:31:29,287
She always
took him back.

1600
01:31:29,322 --> 01:31:31,040
I never understood it.

1601
01:31:31,126 --> 01:31:32,743
She covered the bruises
and the cuts,

1602
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:34,798
And she'd take him back

1603
01:31:34,834 --> 01:31:36,952
Because he begged

1604
01:31:36,988 --> 01:31:38,822
And he cried.

1605
01:31:38,874 --> 01:31:40,525
And now you ask me
what happened

1606
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:41,528
After he came back.

1607
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:42,513
No--
no, go on!

1608
01:31:42,565 --> 01:31:43,649
You said
you wanted to know

1609
01:31:43,701 --> 01:31:44,634
What happened to me.
Now ask me.

1610
01:31:44,686 --> 01:31:45,836
I don't like this.

1611
01:31:45,888 --> 01:31:48,023
Did he hurt you,
eugene? Ask me!

1612
01:31:49,528 --> 01:31:50,645
Did he hurt you?

1613
01:31:51,699 --> 01:31:53,200
Not for long.

1614
01:31:53,286 --> 01:31:56,405
By 13, I was gone.
I ran away...

1615
01:31:56,492 --> 01:31:58,359
But I missed her,

1616
01:31:58,412 --> 01:32:00,580
So I had to go back
and see her.

1617
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:03,534
And so one night, I did.

1618
01:32:03,589 --> 01:32:05,173
Now ask me what
happened that night.

1619
01:32:05,226 --> 01:32:07,376
What happened that night
you came back, eugene?

1620
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:08,763
What happened?

1621
01:32:08,849 --> 01:32:10,216
He was there...

1622
01:32:10,268 --> 01:32:12,069
Drunk as usual.

1623
01:32:12,155 --> 01:32:14,190
Only this time,
I wasn't the same.

1624
01:32:14,243 --> 01:32:15,993
I was 16 years old,

1625
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:18,448
And I was no longer
afraid of him.

1626
01:32:18,534 --> 01:32:20,118
And when I looked
him in the eye

1627
01:32:20,204 --> 01:32:22,255
And told him if he
ever touched her again

1628
01:32:22,341 --> 01:32:23,258
I would kill him,

1629
01:32:23,343 --> 01:32:25,211
He knew...

1630
01:32:25,264 --> 01:32:27,181
He knew that
he would never exist

1631
01:32:27,218 --> 01:32:29,418
For me again.

1632
01:32:29,472 --> 01:32:31,706
And I'm standing
in front of the house.

1633
01:32:31,759 --> 01:32:33,260
I'm telling her,

1634
01:32:33,346 --> 01:32:34,547
I'm screaming
for her to come out.

1635
01:32:34,599 --> 01:32:36,082
I'm telling her
she doesn't have to--

1636
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:37,451
She doesn't have
to take it anymore.

1637
01:32:37,538 --> 01:32:38,454
She really doesn't.

1638
01:32:38,539 --> 01:32:39,505
She can come
with me now.

1639
01:32:39,541 --> 01:32:40,874
I don't even
see it coming.

1640
01:32:40,928 --> 01:32:41,961
He hits me in
the side of the head

1641
01:32:42,046 --> 01:32:42,963
With a 2x4,

1642
01:32:43,048 --> 01:32:44,248
And I'm bleeding
from my ear.

1643
01:32:44,301 --> 01:32:45,884
And then
he's dragging me.

1644
01:32:45,937 --> 01:32:47,053
He's dragging me
behind the house

1645
01:32:47,105 --> 01:32:48,422
And into the garage,
and then he's gone.

1646
01:32:48,475 --> 01:32:50,610
A minute, 5 minutes,
I don't know.

1647
01:32:50,696 --> 01:32:52,430
And then he's back, and
he's wetting me down.

1648
01:32:52,482 --> 01:32:54,900
He's wetting me down,
and I don't understand.

1649
01:32:54,955 --> 01:32:57,539
I don't understand
why water...

1650
01:32:57,576 --> 01:33:00,378
Should smell so bad.

1651
01:33:00,415 --> 01:33:02,132
I don't understand.

1652
01:33:02,218 --> 01:33:05,086
And then I see it.

1653
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:06,924
I see...

1654
01:33:09,399 --> 01:33:10,399
This...

1655
01:33:13,907 --> 01:33:15,658
This gas can,

1656
01:33:15,744 --> 01:33:21,032
This red gas can
from his trunk.

1657
01:33:25,963 --> 01:33:28,965
And he looks at me
one last time...

1658
01:33:30,973 --> 01:33:32,724
And he lights a match.

1659
01:33:36,617 --> 01:33:39,486
And the last thing
I remember...

1660
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:42,024
And I'll never
forget it...

1661
01:33:42,078 --> 01:33:43,879
Were his eyes.

1662
01:33:45,669 --> 01:33:49,638
His eyes because they
were filled with this...

1663
01:33:49,676 --> 01:33:53,145
Immense...

1664
01:33:53,182 --> 01:33:56,351
Satisfaction.

1665
01:33:59,194 --> 01:34:00,561
I'm so sorry--

1666
01:34:00,613 --> 01:34:04,382
Don't--don't--don't tell me
how sorry you are for me!

1667
01:34:04,438 --> 01:34:06,389
Just tell me how
you're gonna stop it

1668
01:34:06,475 --> 01:34:07,475
Happening to trevor.

1669
01:34:07,511 --> 01:34:09,895
Ricky would
never do that.

1670
01:34:09,982 --> 01:34:13,484
Oh, jesus, arlene.
He doesn't have to.

1671
01:34:15,576 --> 01:34:17,744
All he has to do
is not love him.

1672
01:34:31,824 --> 01:34:32,824
[door closes]

1673
01:35:15,407 --> 01:35:16,557

1674
01:35:18,013 --> 01:35:19,013
Jesus!

1675

[radio playing

1676
01:35:26,128 --> 01:35:28,796
â™ª this is my last resort â™ª

1677
01:35:30,186 --> 01:35:31,269
Hey.

1678
01:35:34,110 --> 01:35:35,277
â™ª cut my life
into pieces-- â™ª

1679
01:35:35,363 --> 01:35:36,613
What's going on?

1680
01:35:36,698 --> 01:35:39,317
What's going on?
What's going on?

1681
01:35:39,404 --> 01:35:40,537
What are you doing?

1682
01:35:40,573 --> 01:35:41,790
What's it look
like I'm doing?

1683
01:35:41,875 --> 01:35:43,910
What are you putting
in my room?

1684
01:35:43,963 --> 01:35:46,497
We had an agreement.

1685
01:35:46,584 --> 01:35:48,802
My son won't
talk to me.

1686
01:35:48,888 --> 01:35:50,455
He won't even
look at me!

1687
01:35:50,508 --> 01:35:51,458
What the hell
did you do

1688
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:52,460
To turn him
against me?

1689
01:35:52,512 --> 01:35:53,763
I didn't do anything.

1690
01:35:53,815 --> 01:35:54,965
I told you I wasn't gonna
make him talk to you.

1691
01:35:55,017 --> 01:35:57,068
You could go
get a job.

1692
01:35:57,104 --> 01:35:58,471
What am I supposed
to use for a car?

1693
01:35:58,523 --> 01:35:59,991
The bus.
That's what I do.

1694
01:36:00,077 --> 01:36:01,477
Yeah, that'll
be the day.

1695
01:36:01,529 --> 01:36:03,530
Ricky, you can't
stay in this room.

1696
01:36:03,617 --> 01:36:04,750
Look, this is
our room, baby.

1697
01:36:04,786 --> 01:36:06,753
Ok, this is our house.
This is our bed--

1698
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:07,756
You've been drinking.

1699
01:36:07,792 --> 01:36:08,758
Kiss me.
Stop it.

1700
01:36:08,794 --> 01:36:11,195
Stop it. Stop it.

1701
01:36:11,281 --> 01:36:13,282
â™ª I never realized
I was spread too thin â™ª

â™ª and I was empty within-- â™ª

1704
01:36:16,108 --> 01:36:18,326

Turn that noise down!

1708
01:36:22,671 --> 01:36:24,204
I'm gonna come in there
and pound your ass, boy!

1709
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:26,274
Don't talk to him
like that.

1710
01:36:26,327 --> 01:36:28,578
[music stops]

1711
01:36:28,615 --> 01:36:30,783
I've had enough of
this shit around here.

1712
01:36:30,836 --> 01:36:31,786
Yeah, what are you
gonna do?

1713
01:36:31,838 --> 01:36:33,655
Get out!

1714
01:36:33,708 --> 01:36:35,292
You know, I like you
a whole lot better

1715
01:36:35,344 --> 01:36:36,795

[pounds on door]

You want me out

01:36:40,872 --> 01:36:42,473
Sorry.

1719
01:36:47,485 --> 01:36:50,037
I think
I made a mistake.

1720
01:36:55,717 --> 01:36:58,152
Everybody

[school bell rings]

1732
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:00,439
All right,

1733
01:38:00,491 --> 01:38:02,376
Thank you.
Carefully.

1734
01:38:04,917 --> 01:38:07,585
Thank you. Careful. Did you
get rid of your hiccups?

1735
01:38:07,639 --> 01:38:08,789
Girl: Yes.
Good.

1736
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:10,475
I told you holding
your breath would work.

1737
01:38:10,561 --> 01:38:11,477
Thank you.

1738
01:38:11,563 --> 01:38:14,264
Careful. Thank you.

1739
01:38:14,318 --> 01:38:18,271
Thanks.
That's very nice.

1740
01:38:18,326 --> 01:38:19,910
Give me that one.

1741
01:38:19,946 --> 01:38:23,648
Thank you.
Thank you.

1742
01:38:23,703 --> 01:38:25,854
Thank you.
Thank you.

1743
01:38:34,641 --> 01:38:36,242
Trevor, what is it?

1744
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:39,946
Are you still gonna
pay it forward?

1745
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:48,112
You could say
you don't have to.

1746
01:38:48,150 --> 01:38:50,684
'cause it
didn't work out.

1747
01:38:50,739 --> 01:38:53,490
But I thought
you still might.

1748
01:39:00,139 --> 01:39:02,858
Trevor, I would like
more than anything

1749
01:39:02,945 --> 01:39:04,813
To do that for you.

1750
01:39:04,866 --> 01:39:07,484
And when I find
something worthy of--

1751
01:39:07,537 --> 01:39:09,538
I know somebody
who needs something.

1752
01:39:09,624 --> 01:39:12,043
Trevor, you have to let
me find this on my own.

1753
01:39:12,129 --> 01:39:14,197
You know who it is.

1754
01:39:16,655 --> 01:39:18,373
Look...

1755
01:39:18,458 --> 01:39:22,378
You don't understand
everything, all right?

1756
01:39:22,466 --> 01:39:25,218
So you do not know
what you're asking.

1757
01:39:25,305 --> 01:39:28,090
Give her
another chance.

1758
01:39:30,932 --> 01:39:34,935
I will pay it forward,
I promise you that...

1759
01:39:35,007 --> 01:39:37,475
But I cannot do that.

1760
01:39:50,887 --> 01:39:53,772
But that's why
this is the one...

1761
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:56,578
Because it's
supposed to be

1762
01:39:56,649 --> 01:39:58,149
Something hard.

1763
01:40:01,424 --> 01:40:02,491
If you hp my mom,

1764
01:40:02,576 --> 01:40:04,110
Even if you're
still mad at her,

1765
01:40:04,163 --> 01:40:05,113
If you helped her
in a way

1766
01:40:05,164 --> 01:40:06,248
Nobody else could--

1767
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:07,417
Did she ask you
to come talk to me--

1768
01:40:07,470 --> 01:40:08,870
No. She thinks you'll
never forgive her,

1769
01:40:08,905 --> 01:40:10,790
But I still think
you could.

1770
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:15,965
If you wanted to do
something really huge...

1771
01:40:19,476 --> 01:40:21,594
For someone...

1772
01:40:23,149 --> 01:40:24,633
For my project...

1773
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:31,361
For me.

1774
01:40:37,176 --> 01:40:38,543
Trevor,
she made her choice.

1775
01:40:38,629 --> 01:40:40,329
She said
she made a mistake.

1776
01:40:40,382 --> 01:40:42,717
Well, that's
the beauty of hindsight.

1777
01:41:00,370 --> 01:41:01,954
You don't care.

1778
01:41:04,378 --> 01:41:06,646
Yes, I do.

1779
01:41:06,716 --> 01:41:09,218
I will always care.

1780
01:41:09,305 --> 01:41:11,506
About you, always.

1781
01:41:14,632 --> 01:41:16,149
Yeah.

1782
01:41:17,654 --> 01:41:19,488
You're my teacher.

1783
01:41:19,541 --> 01:41:22,076
They pay you to.

1784
01:42:09,905 --> 01:42:10,988
You got it?

1785
01:42:11,074 --> 01:42:12,124
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.

1786
01:42:16,417 --> 01:42:19,002
I ain't saying a thing
till I get one more.

1787
01:42:19,089 --> 01:42:21,724
You know...

1788
01:42:21,761 --> 01:42:24,146
I thought you might
feel that way.

1789
01:42:27,321 --> 01:42:29,940
Uh-uh, no, no. Later.

1790
01:42:38,844 --> 01:42:40,878
I got my places,

1791
01:42:40,965 --> 01:42:43,266
Places...

1792
01:42:43,302 --> 01:42:46,104
Where nobody cares where
you park overnight.

1793
01:42:48,946 --> 01:42:52,365
Places where I live.

1794
01:42:52,453 --> 01:42:57,640
Anybody who knows me
knows where to find me.

1795
01:43:10,488 --> 01:43:12,155
Hi, mom.

1796
01:43:14,128 --> 01:43:15,378
What are you doing here?

1797
01:43:15,464 --> 01:43:17,081
I wanted to see you.

1798
01:43:19,672 --> 01:43:20,972
After 3 years--

1799
01:43:21,008 --> 01:43:24,177
I couldn't--I can't
watch you do this.

1800
01:43:28,272 --> 01:43:29,522
I drive by
your house.

1801
01:43:29,574 --> 01:43:31,108
I know.

1802
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:33,830
He's big.

1803
01:43:33,866 --> 01:43:34,866
Yeah.

1804
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,624
What are you doing here?

1805
01:43:39,711 --> 01:43:41,678
Are--are you...

1806
01:43:41,715 --> 01:43:44,300
Are you gonna try
to put me somewhere?

1807
01:43:44,386 --> 01:43:46,220
No.

1808
01:43:46,273 --> 01:43:48,942
Then what do you want?

1809
01:43:49,028 --> 01:43:52,898
I want to try
to do something.

1810
01:43:57,244 --> 01:44:00,313
All the things...

1811
01:44:00,384 --> 01:44:02,084
When I was a kid...

1812
01:44:04,057 --> 01:44:07,509
The booze...

1813
01:44:07,581 --> 01:44:09,232
And the men.

1814
01:44:11,238 --> 01:44:12,154
What happened to me

1815
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:14,324
When you
weren't looking.

1816
01:44:18,369 --> 01:44:20,753
I know
we're all weak.

1817
01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:22,156
Oh, not you--

1818
01:44:22,209 --> 01:44:24,794
No, I've been weak.

1819
01:44:26,634 --> 01:44:28,385
Well...

1820
01:44:28,471 --> 01:44:30,305
Here's the thing.

1821
01:44:34,650 --> 01:44:36,534
I forgive you.

1822
01:44:54,187 --> 01:44:56,022
Oh...

1823
01:45:11,938 --> 01:45:13,472
I don't like
your hair--

1824
01:45:13,558 --> 01:45:16,110
I know. I'm not
putting it back.

1825
01:45:20,538 --> 01:45:23,106
So, I'd like to
see you sometimes.

1826
01:45:23,159 --> 01:45:24,659
Is that ok?

1827
01:45:27,384 --> 01:45:28,751
Yes.

1828
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:31,640
You can't
live with me?

1829
01:45:31,726 --> 01:45:32,726
No.

1830
01:45:34,765 --> 01:45:36,182
I wouldn't want to.

1831
01:45:36,268 --> 01:45:37,268
Ha ha.

1832
01:45:39,608 --> 01:45:41,809
Can I see him?

1833
01:45:41,879 --> 01:45:43,913
Not drunk.

1834
01:45:43,950 --> 01:45:44,916
You gotta be sober,

1835
01:45:44,952 --> 01:45:46,369
Even if it's
just for 2 hours.

1836
01:45:46,454 --> 01:45:48,122
Yeah, I can do that.

1837
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:49,175
Ok.

1838
01:45:53,969 --> 01:45:55,553
Well, then I'll
come and find you.

1839
01:45:55,639 --> 01:45:56,639
Ok?

1840
01:45:58,027 --> 01:46:00,028
Yeah.

1841
01:46:00,114 --> 01:46:02,065
Ok.

1842
01:46:02,152 --> 01:46:04,319
Why'd you
do this, arley?

1843
01:46:08,496 --> 01:46:13,700
So, she told me why.

1844
01:46:13,756 --> 01:46:18,844
She told me I had
to do something big...

1845
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:20,901
For 3 other people.

1846
01:46:20,987 --> 01:46:24,273
â™ª happy birthday,
dear trevor â™ª

1847
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:28,580
â™ª happy birthday to you â™ª

1848
01:46:28,669 --> 01:46:32,121
â™ª and many more â™ª

1849
01:46:32,209 --> 01:46:34,126
[cheering and applause]

1850
01:46:41,877 --> 01:46:43,711
[cheering and applause]

1851
01:46:43,764 --> 01:46:46,049
What'd you wish for?
What'd you wish for?

1852
01:46:46,102 --> 01:46:47,336
He can't tell you
what he wished for,

1853
01:46:47,371 --> 01:46:48,371
Or it won't come true.

1854
01:46:48,423 --> 01:46:51,074
Can I have some napkins?

1855
01:46:51,129 --> 01:46:53,079
Who wants a big--
where's my knife?

1856
01:46:53,133 --> 01:46:54,283
[knock on door]

1857
01:46:56,172 --> 01:46:57,456
I'll get it.

1858
01:47:04,087 --> 01:47:05,087
Mom?

1859
01:47:07,176 --> 01:47:08,243
Hello.

1860
01:47:08,295 --> 01:47:09,412
Hi. Mrs. Mckinney,
I'm chris chandler.

1861
01:47:09,464 --> 01:47:10,547
I'm a reporter.
I was wondering

1862
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:11,683
If I could have
a moment of your time.

1863
01:47:11,718 --> 01:47:13,169
Why?

1864
01:47:13,204 --> 01:47:14,904
I don't have anything
to say about anything.

1865
01:47:14,958 --> 01:47:17,293
Please, I've already
spoken to your mother,

1866
01:47:17,379 --> 01:47:19,180
Which naturally
led me to you, so...

1867
01:47:19,216 --> 01:47:20,166
My mother?

1868
01:47:20,201 --> 01:47:21,168
She told me about

1869
01:47:21,203 --> 01:47:22,320
The pay it forward
idea

1870
01:47:22,356 --> 01:47:23,356
And how you've
helped her out,

1871
01:47:23,408 --> 01:47:24,408
And I'm doing
a story about it.

1872
01:47:24,493 --> 01:47:25,893
No, no, you can't.
That's private.

1873
01:47:25,946 --> 01:47:26,895
Ok, mrs. Mckinney--

1874
01:47:26,948 --> 01:47:27,897
My son's upset
about it.

1875
01:47:27,983 --> 01:47:29,317
It was
a social studies thing,

1876
01:47:29,352 --> 01:47:30,986
And it didn't work out
the way he wanted it to.

1877
01:47:31,022 --> 01:47:32,022
Social studies?

1878
01:47:32,074 --> 01:47:33,391
Yeah. Please
just leave it alone.

1879
01:47:33,477 --> 01:47:35,311
He just wants to get on
with the seventh grade.

1880
01:47:35,347 --> 01:47:36,714
Seventh grade?
How do you--

1881
01:47:36,766 --> 01:47:38,317
Plus it's his birthday party,
and it's a bad time, ok?

1882
01:47:38,353 --> 01:47:39,320
I'm sorry to--

1883
01:47:39,354 --> 01:47:41,238
No, I'm sorry,
mrs. Mckinney.

1884
01:47:41,325 --> 01:47:42,241
I've been
tracking this story

1885
01:47:42,327 --> 01:47:43,911
From los angeles, ok?

1886
01:47:43,997 --> 01:47:45,581
Pay it forward,
the movement--

1887
01:47:45,667 --> 01:47:47,084
It's reached l.A.,
mrs. Mckinney.

1888
01:47:47,170 --> 01:47:48,904
Come on, the movement?

1889
01:47:48,956 --> 01:47:50,273
Yeah. You're
telling me your son

1890
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:51,910
Had something
to do with this?

1891
01:47:51,996 --> 01:47:53,663
Aah!

1892
01:47:53,699 --> 01:47:55,333
Aah!

1893
01:47:55,369 --> 01:47:57,269
Aah!

1894
01:47:57,356 --> 01:47:58,856
Aah!

1895
01:48:03,033 --> 01:48:04,100
[imitates crash]

1896
01:48:04,185 --> 01:48:06,020
We really appreciate
this, ms. Mckinney.

1897
01:48:06,073 --> 01:48:07,573
It's up to him.

1898
01:48:07,659 --> 01:48:09,160
Good.

1899
01:48:09,195 --> 01:48:10,496
Ready, slugger?

1900
01:48:10,531 --> 01:48:11,581
I guess.

1901
01:48:11,666 --> 01:48:13,734
There you go.
Up here, please, sir.

1902
01:48:13,787 --> 01:48:16,005
Just like you're
getting a haircut.

1903
01:48:16,042 --> 01:48:18,043
You ever been
interviewed before?

1904
01:48:18,096 --> 01:48:19,429
No.

1905
01:48:19,516 --> 01:48:21,967
Hey, trevor.

1906
01:48:22,054 --> 01:48:23,537
This is for you.

1907
01:48:23,589 --> 01:48:25,090
Hi. How are you?

1908
01:48:25,176 --> 01:48:26,176
What's your name?

1909
01:48:26,212 --> 01:48:28,463
Chris chandler.
Nice to meet you.

1910
01:48:28,549 --> 01:48:30,083
A little less painful
than a trip to the dentist.

1911
01:48:30,135 --> 01:48:31,769
You're gonna be great.
Just be yourself, ok, pal?

1912
01:48:31,839 --> 01:48:32,889
Ok.
You ready to go?

1913
01:48:32,941 --> 01:48:34,058
I guess.
You guess?

1914
01:48:34,110 --> 01:48:35,861
Come on, you gotta
have some gusto here.

1915
01:48:35,897 --> 01:48:36,980
Are we ready?

1916
01:48:37,066 --> 01:48:38,566
All right, let's go.
All right, great.

1917
01:48:38,618 --> 01:48:41,537
Ok, now, just be
yourself. Relax.

1918
01:48:41,574 --> 01:48:43,876
It's gonna be
a lot of fun, ok?

1919
01:48:43,912 --> 01:48:44,912
All right.

1920
01:48:49,389 --> 01:48:52,091
Ok, we're on?

1921
01:48:52,145 --> 01:48:54,629
Hi, I'm chris chandler,
and I'm joined today

1922
01:48:54,683 --> 01:48:56,633
By a very unusual
seventh grader,

1923
01:48:56,687 --> 01:48:59,155
Trevor mckinney.

1924
01:48:59,241 --> 01:49:00,525
Trevor,
you must be

1925
01:49:00,611 --> 01:49:01,828
Pretty proud
of yourself.

1926
01:49:01,914 --> 01:49:03,247
No.

1927
01:49:03,283 --> 01:49:06,001
So you're not
proud at all?

1928
01:49:06,088 --> 01:49:10,258
I don't know.
I guess.

1929
01:49:10,297 --> 01:49:12,264
Come on,
you start a movement

1930
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:14,167
Like pay it forward.
You're not proud?

1931
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:18,507
I guess. I mean, I got
an "a" in social studies,

1932
01:49:18,562 --> 01:49:21,464
But that was
just for the effort.

1933
01:49:21,518 --> 01:49:24,637
I mean, the stuff I did
didn't really work out.

1934
01:49:25,693 --> 01:49:27,110
You're here.

1935
01:49:27,145 --> 01:49:28,178
Yeah, but...

1936
01:49:28,231 --> 01:49:30,532
I don't know.
I tried real hard,

1937
01:49:30,618 --> 01:49:34,738
But nothing
really happened.

1938
01:49:34,826 --> 01:49:36,744
My mom's stuff
worked.

1939
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:38,081
She talked
to my grandma,

1940
01:49:38,149 --> 01:49:39,917
Kind of made up
with her,

1941
01:49:39,987 --> 01:49:42,121
And it was
really hard for her.

1942
01:49:42,191 --> 01:49:43,708
It was great for me,

1943
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:46,495
Because my grandma came
to my birthday party,

1944
01:49:46,566 --> 01:49:50,686
And I had
really missed her.

1945
01:49:52,076 --> 01:49:53,410
And that's why
pay it forward

1946
01:49:53,495 --> 01:49:55,330
Went to all
those places...

1947
01:49:55,366 --> 01:49:57,066
'cause of my mom.

1948
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:01,506
'cause
she was so brave.

1949
01:50:01,578 --> 01:50:03,379
My stuff,
I--I don't know.

1950
01:50:03,432 --> 01:50:06,401
I think some people are
too scared or something.

1951
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:10,006
I think things
can be different...

1952
01:50:10,078 --> 01:50:12,363
And, I mean,
the world's--

1953
01:50:12,399 --> 01:50:16,101
The world's
not exactly...

1954
01:50:16,156 --> 01:50:18,123
Shit.

1955
01:50:20,147 --> 01:50:22,599
But I guess it's hard
for some people

1956
01:50:22,668 --> 01:50:25,353
Who are so used to things
the way they are--

1957
01:50:25,391 --> 01:50:28,293
Even if they're bad--

1958
01:50:28,363 --> 01:50:31,782
To change...

1959
01:50:31,853 --> 01:50:35,072
And they kind of give up.

1960
01:50:39,251 --> 01:50:43,137
When they do,
everybody kind of...

1961
01:50:43,224 --> 01:50:44,925
Kind of loses.

1962
01:51:12,230 --> 01:51:13,731
Arlene...

1963
01:51:16,823 --> 01:51:17,990
I don't want to be
one of those people

1964
01:51:18,042 --> 01:51:20,193
He's talking about,

1965
01:51:20,246 --> 01:51:22,381
And I've become one.

1966
01:51:25,757 --> 01:51:26,706
I don't want
to spend

1967
01:51:26,759 --> 01:51:28,176
Another second
of wasted air.

1968
01:51:31,267 --> 01:51:34,553
Please don't let me stay
trapped in here forever.

1969
01:51:34,607 --> 01:51:35,741
I won't.

1970
01:51:35,826 --> 01:51:36,743
I don't
want to spend

1971
01:51:36,828 --> 01:51:38,445
Another second
without you.

1972
01:51:49,135 --> 01:51:52,253
Girl: Trevor,
that was awesome.

1973
01:51:52,341 --> 01:51:54,091
See you later, guys.

1974
01:51:54,178 --> 01:51:55,094
Boy: Tomorrow, right?

1975
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:56,380
Bye, man.

1976
01:51:58,937 --> 01:52:00,587
Let me go!
Stop it!

1977
01:52:00,674 --> 01:52:01,540
Who'd you tell?

1978
01:52:01,592 --> 01:52:02,709
Stop it!

1979
01:52:02,761 --> 01:52:04,212
Who'd you tell,
tattletale?

1980
01:52:04,264 --> 01:52:06,048
I didn't tell anybody.

1981
01:52:06,101 --> 01:52:07,685
Ah, ah, ah!

1982
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:11,090
I swear I didn't
say anything!

1983
01:52:11,144 --> 01:52:12,211
Help!

1984
01:52:14,634 --> 01:52:17,503
Let me go.
Stop it.

1985
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:18,540
Trevor!

1986
01:52:23,501 --> 01:52:24,501
Come here.

1987
01:52:28,511 --> 01:52:29,861
Eugene: Hey!
Let me go!

1988
01:52:29,913 --> 01:52:31,330
Trevor!

1989
01:52:31,382 --> 01:52:34,668
No, trevor! Hey!

1990
01:52:34,723 --> 01:52:36,090
Get out of my face!

1991
01:52:36,175 --> 01:52:37,142
Punch him. Come on!

1992
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:39,380
No!

1993
01:52:40,367 --> 01:52:41,634
Eugene: Leave him alone!

1994
01:52:41,686 --> 01:52:42,769
Trevor!

1995
01:52:42,821 --> 01:52:44,239
Trevor?

1996
01:52:44,274 --> 01:52:45,941
Unh!

1997
01:52:50,403 --> 01:52:51,870
Trevor?!

1998
01:53:03,444 --> 01:53:05,729
Someone get
an ambulance!

1999
01:54:00,871 --> 01:54:04,257
Trevor: But I guess it's hard
for some people who are...

2000
01:54:04,294 --> 01:54:06,495
So used to things
the way they are--

2001
01:54:06,549 --> 01:54:10,602
Even if they're bad--
to change...

2002
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:12,941
Because...

2003
01:54:12,978 --> 01:54:15,846
I guess they kinda give up.

2004
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:19,953
And when they do...

2005
01:54:19,992 --> 01:54:23,494
Everybody kinda loses.

2006
01:54:24,584 --> 01:54:26,468
Newsman: These moments
make you sorry

2007
01:54:26,504 --> 01:54:28,472
To have to report
anything at all.

2008
01:54:28,508 --> 01:54:30,976
This remarkable young man
died at 7:35 this evening.

2009
01:54:31,013 --> 01:54:32,980
Newswoman: There are
now confirmed incidents

2010
01:54:33,017 --> 01:54:34,484
Of pay it forward

2011
01:54:34,519 --> 01:54:35,986
In los angeles,
san francisco.

2012
01:54:36,023 --> 01:54:37,990
And in phoenix,
we're checking to see

2013
01:54:38,027 --> 01:54:39,994
If the 16
foster children

2014
01:54:40,030 --> 01:54:41,664
Who just received
computers

2015
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:43,835
Is in any way connected
to this movement.

2016
01:54:43,871 --> 01:54:46,873
Trevor: It's hard.
You can't plan it.

2017
01:54:48,379 --> 01:54:51,348
You have to watch people
more, you know,

2018
01:54:51,385 --> 01:54:53,520
Sort of...

2019
01:54:53,556 --> 01:54:55,524
Sort of keep an eye on 'em

2020
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:59,029
To protect 'em, because...

2021
01:54:59,067 --> 01:55:01,618
They can't always
see what they need.

2022
01:55:04,711 --> 01:55:06,628
It's--it's like
your big chance

2023
01:55:06,715 --> 01:55:08,833
To fix something
that's not like your bike.

2024
01:55:16,817 --> 01:55:18,484
You can...Fix a person.

2025
01:55:18,571 --> 01:55:20,989
Chris: Is that what
you want for your birthday,

2026
01:55:21,075 --> 01:55:22,993
Everybody
to pay it forward?

2027
01:55:23,079 --> 01:55:24,747
I can't ask for that.

2028
01:55:24,783 --> 01:55:27,001
Sure, you can.
Why not?

2029
01:55:27,087 --> 01:55:28,171
Wouldn't work.

2030
01:55:28,256 --> 01:55:29,840
Why?

2031
01:55:36,856 --> 01:55:39,474
I already
blew out my candles.

2032
