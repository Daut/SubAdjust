I'll kill her!

I'm a reporter.
I'm with the press,

13

How long have
you guys been here?

14
00:01:54,238 --> 00:01:55,187
Get out of here!

15
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,323
Is this domestic
or drugs?

16
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,325
Is that
his girlfriend

17
00:01:57,377 --> 00:01:58,327
Or what?
Get out of here!

18
00:01:58,379 --> 00:01:59,329
Who is it?

00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:0,331
Come on,
talk to me.

please get him

Out of here.
Walk!

I got my passes, masius.

every right

25
00:02:5,860 --> 00:02:6,793

Where'd he go?

Having a little
car trouble?

00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,448
That's a keen
observation.

38
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:20,985
I can help you.

39
00:03:23,626 --> 00:03:24,993
It's the jag.

40
00:03:25,46 --> 00:03:27,530
You want me
to drive home

41
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,717
In your car?

42
00:03:28,802 --> 00:03:30,703
No. I want you
to take my car.

43
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:34,309
Had a lot of luck lately.
I don't need it.

44
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:36,898
You're giving me
a brand-new jaguar,

45
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:38,269
And you don't
want anything?

46
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:40,989
Well, I can prove it.
Give me your card.

[grrr]

48
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:52,512

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
What is this?

50
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:54,935
What--what?
Do you want me

51
00:03:55,20 --> 00:03:56,220
To kill your wife
or something?

52
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:59,57
No. Tempting, but, no.

53
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:2,480
Call it generosity
between 2 strangers.

54
00:04:2,568 --> 00:04:6,604
Generosity? Hey, fella,
it's a jaguar.

55
00:04:6,658 --> 00:04:7,708
You expect me
to drive off

56
00:04:7,744 --> 00:04:9,328
In a brand-new jaguar,
and that's it?

57
00:04:9,414 --> 00:04:10,397
That's right.

58
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,817
Hey! You're a freak.
You know that?

59
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:13,152
You are a freak.

60
00:04:13,238 --> 00:04:14,738
You want me
to get in this car?

61
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,76
No way. It's probably
going to blow up.

62
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:18,129
Yeah. That's real funny.

63
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:19,715
Bits and pieces of me
raining down

64
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,717
In the street.

65
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:22,703
Ha ha. You think

66
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:24,624
I'm going near
that thing? You're nuts!

67
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,628
Besides, I've got a car.

68
00:04:29,85 --> 00:04:30,502
Sort of.

Cool blade, huh?

73
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:29,666
Want to see
your guts--

74
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:31,386
Keep it in your pants.

75
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:34,393
Fag.

76
00:05:34,427 --> 00:05:36,345
He's going
to kill you.

77
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:37,931
I got pepper spray.

Apparently none of you
have ever seen

82
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:28,796
A new teacher before.

83
00:06:30,1 --> 00:06:31,969
I'm mr. Simonet.

84
00:06:32,5 --> 00:06:35,541
Welcome to the seventh
grade, middle school--

85
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,930
That hellish,
shaky bridge

86
00:06:38,16 --> 00:06:40,184
You all must cross
before you become

87
00:06:40,237 --> 00:06:42,739
Members of
that undyingly enviable

88
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:44,260
High-school elite.

89
00:06:44,328 --> 00:06:46,129
Now, some of you might
think you can't get

90
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,566
Across this bridge
fast enough,

91
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:49,52
That you'd rather
hold your breath,

92
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:50,605
Close your eyes,
and not think

93
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:52,124
About anything
until it's all over.

94
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:55,312
Well, I'm here
to tell you

95
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,301
That that is not
an option in this class.

Busted.

99
00:07:3,866 --> 00:07:5,533
Tardiness--

100
00:07:5,620 --> 00:07:7,821
To be late
for your first class

101
00:07:7,874 --> 00:07:9,341
On your first day
of school,

102
00:07:9,426 --> 00:07:11,511
What does that indicate?

103
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:14,49
I'm having
a bad hair day.

104
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,119
[students laugh]

105
00:07:15,172 --> 00:07:16,989
Perhaps
what it indicates

106
00:07:17,41 --> 00:07:18,792
Is a lack of respect.

107
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:21,196
You see, I'm going
to be here every day

108
00:07:21,283 --> 00:07:22,416
For you.

109
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:26,154
And so, I expect you
to be here for me.

110
00:07:26,243 --> 00:07:30,446
On time. No excuses.

111
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:31,651
Put that down.

112
00:07:31,703 --> 00:07:33,420
[whispering]
wait.

113
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:37,44
Now...

114
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,999
This class is
social studies.

115
00:07:41,55 --> 00:07:43,890
That is you
and the world.

116
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:46,695
Yes, there is
a world out there,

117
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:48,983
And even if you decide
you don't want

118
00:07:49,36 --> 00:07:50,36
To meet it,
it's still

119
00:07:50,122 --> 00:07:52,907
Going to hit you
right in the face.

120
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:54,879
Believe me.

121
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:57,549
So, best you start
thinking about

122
00:07:57,636 --> 00:07:58,553
The world now

123
00:07:58,638 --> 00:08:1,707
And what it means
to you.

124
00:08:1,761 --> 00:08:5,314
What does the world
mean to you?

125
00:08:6,938 --> 00:08:9,323
Come on! A little class
participation here.

126
00:08:9,359 --> 00:08:11,360
Is it just this class
you want to get out of?

127
00:08:11,413 --> 00:08:12,997
Your house? Your street?

128
00:08:13,32 --> 00:08:16,168
Any further any of you
want to go than that?

129
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,172
Yes.

130
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:18,958
The mall.
That's only,

131
00:08:19,44 --> 00:08:20,545
Like, 2 miles
away from me.

132
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,100
Well, let me ask you
another question.

133
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:26,805
How often do you
think about things

134
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:28,893
That happen outside
of this town?

135
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:31,348
You watch the news? Yes?

136
00:08:31,384 --> 00:08:32,685
No?

137
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,438
All right. So we're
not global thinkers yet,

138
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:36,859
But why aren't we?

139
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:40,983
'cause we're 11.

140
00:08:41,70 --> 00:08:43,187
Good point.
What's your name?

141
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:44,557
Trevor.

142
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:46,694
Maybe trevor's
absolutely right.

143
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,147
Why should we think
about the world?

144
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:49,868
I mean, after all,
what does the world

145
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:50,870
Expect of us?

146
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,605
Expect?

147
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:54,376
Mm-mmm. Of you.

148
00:08:54,412 --> 00:08:58,48
Mr. Simonet: What does
the world expect of you?

149
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:0,989
Nothing.

150
00:09:1,976 --> 00:09:3,193
Nothing.

151
00:09:3,229 --> 00:09:6,482
My god, boys and girls,
he's absolutely right.

152
00:09:6,569 --> 00:09:8,537
Nothing.

153
00:09:8,572 --> 00:09:10,456
I mean, here you are.
You can't drive.

154
00:09:10,543 --> 00:09:12,377
You can't vote. You can't
even go to the bathroom

155
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:14,965
Without a pass from me.
You're stuck!

156
00:09:15,51 --> 00:09:18,3
Right here,
in the seventh grade.

157
00:09:19,978 --> 00:09:23,347
But not forever.

158
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:26,269
Because one day,
you'll be free.

159
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:28,108
[students cheering]

160
00:09:30,281 --> 00:09:33,300
All right. But what if
on that day you're free,

161
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:36,255
You haven't prepared,
you're not ready,

162
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,576
And then
you look around you

163
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:41,164
And you don't like
what the world is?

164
00:09:41,252 --> 00:09:42,970
What if the world...

165
00:09:43,55 --> 00:09:47,92
Is just
a big disappointment?

166
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:48,764
We're screwed.

167
00:09:48,817 --> 00:09:50,651
Unless--

168
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:54,606
Unless you take the things
that you don't like

169
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:58,80
About this world and
you flip them upside down

170
00:09:58,118 --> 00:10:0,85
Right on their ass--
don't tell your parents

171
00:10:0,122 --> 00:10:4,91
I used that word--
and you can start that...

172
00:10:4,130 --> 00:10:5,630
Today!

173
00:10:7,436 --> 00:10:10,4
This is
your assignment.

174
00:10:10,57 --> 00:10:11,941
Extra credit.

175
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:15,814
It goes on
all year long.

176
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:17,303
[students groan]

177
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:18,638
Now, wait a minute.
What?

178
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,974
What? What's wrong
with this?

179
00:10:20,27 --> 00:10:20,977
What's the matter?

180
00:10:21,29 --> 00:10:21,979
Yes?

181
00:10:22,30 --> 00:10:24,14
It's--it's, like, so--

182
00:10:24,67 --> 00:10:27,119
So what? There must
be a word to finish

183
00:10:27,174 --> 00:10:28,591
That sentence.
Someone help her?

184
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:29,594
Weird.
Weird.

185
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:30,578
Crazy.
Crazy.

186
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:31,580
Hard.

187
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:32,582
Bummer.

188
00:10:32,617 --> 00:10:34,952
Bummer. Hard.

189
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:40,261
How about possible?

190
00:10:42,804 --> 00:10:44,21
It's possible.

191
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:49,345
The realm of possibility

192
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,902
Exists where

193
00:10:51,988 --> 00:10:53,322
In each of you?

194
00:10:56,79 --> 00:10:58,197
[whispering] here.

195
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:0,501
So you can do it.

196
00:11:0,554 --> 00:11:3,206
You can surprise us.

197
00:11:3,260 --> 00:11:4,894
It's up to you.

198
00:11:4,980 --> 00:11:7,30
Or you can
just sit back

199
00:11:7,84 --> 00:11:9,669
And let it atrophy.

200
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:13,209
Atrophy.

201
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:14,930
If there is
a word you hear

202
00:11:15,15 --> 00:11:16,232
That you don't
understand,

203
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:17,736
There's a dictionary
at the front of the room.

204
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:19,689
Look it up.

205
00:11:19,742 --> 00:11:21,392
And there are
these dictionaries,

206
00:11:21,444 --> 00:11:23,829
Which you will carry
with you at all times,

207
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:26,585
Because in this class,
we're going to learn

208
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:29,406
To love words
and their meanings.

209
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,961
Any questions?

210
00:11:31,46 --> 00:11:32,930
Trevor: Yeah.

211
00:11:33,17 --> 00:11:34,467
So you'll,
like, flunk us

212
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:35,636
If we
don't change

213
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:36,639
The world?

214
00:11:36,724 --> 00:11:38,424
Well, no.
I wouldn't do that.

215
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:42,314
But you might just
squeak by with a "c."

216
00:11:45,858 --> 00:11:49,227
What'd you ever do
to change the world?

217
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:52,50
Students: Whoa!

218
00:11:53,273 --> 00:11:55,524
Well, trevor, I get
a good night's sleep,

219
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,645
I eat a hearty
breakfast,

220
00:11:57,731 --> 00:12:1,868
I show up on time,

221
00:12:1,906 --> 00:12:5,575
And then I pass
the buck to you.

222
00:12:8,886 --> 00:12:11,3
Now, I want you all
to write your names

223
00:12:11,90 --> 00:12:13,641
In these books,
and--what's your name?

224
00:12:13,729 --> 00:12:15,313
Molly? All right.

225
00:12:15,398 --> 00:12:18,150
I want molly to look up
the word "atrophy."

00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:33,676
No, we're not coming
down to milwaukee.

228
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,681
No. You went
straight to hell.

229
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,568
Straight to hell.

230
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:38,987
Ok. 4 tequilas.
Who's having

231
00:15:39,40 --> 00:15:40,291
The fourth one?
You are.

232
00:15:40,326 --> 00:15:41,293
Oh, no, no.

233
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:42,295
Not for me.
Thank you.

234
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,297
You cannot
get in trouble.

235
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:44,299
We bought it
for you.

236
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,300
I thank you
so much.

237
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:46,335
No, thank you.

238
00:15:46,387 --> 00:15:47,304
Oh, come on.
Why not?

239
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:48,339
Because
I promised my kid.

241
00:15:49,393 --> 00:15:50,543

What time
do you get off?

If only
I weren't married!

Yeah.

have a choice.

That's not
really breakfast.

you won't throw up?

supposed to mean?

What do you think
it means?

00:22:42,956 --> 00:22:44,673
Why don't you tell me
what it means.

My suggestion to you is
if you want to know,

363
00:24:51,252 --> 00:24:52,702
Why don't you go home
and talk to your son.

Yeah! And?

370
00:25:7,784 --> 00:25:10,986
It's an assignment
I give out

371
00:25:11,40 --> 00:25:12,758
At the beginning
of every year to inspire.

372
00:25:12,793 --> 00:25:13,927
I don't expect them

373
00:25:13,962 --> 00:25:15,462
To actually change
the world, the whole--

374
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:16,799
You expect them
to change the--

375
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:18,468
Excuse me.
It's to get them to think,

376
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,338
Not walk on water.
It's a very good assignment.

377
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:21,341
You give them
an assignment

378
00:25:21,393 --> 00:25:22,343
You don't think
they can do.

379
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,645
What kind of teacher
are you?

380
00:25:23,697 --> 00:25:25,782
I didn't say that.
You know, they make attempts.

381
00:25:25,818 --> 00:25:27,369
Every now and then, they
clean up a little graffiti

382
00:25:27,455 --> 00:25:28,472
Before
they lose interest.

383
00:25:28,524 --> 00:25:29,474
Hey! This is my kid!

384
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:30,693
You don't know him.

385
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:33,96
You tell him
he can do something,

386
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,349
He's going
to believe you.

387
00:25:34,435 --> 00:25:35,351
And when he can't,

388
00:25:35,437 --> 00:25:36,870
It's going
to wipe him out.

389
00:25:36,956 --> 00:25:38,123
They ought
to fire your ass

390
00:25:38,176 --> 00:25:39,960
Out of here
right now!

391
00:25:40,12 --> 00:25:42,980
Well, you know,
they probably won't do that,

392
00:25:43,35 --> 00:25:45,119
Because I fill
a very excellent quota.

393
00:25:45,172 --> 00:25:48,124
I'm just this side
of parking in the blue zone.

394
00:25:48,178 --> 00:25:49,195
Oh, so you think

395
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,330
You can do
whatever you want

396
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:51,916
Just 'cause
your face is messed up?

397
00:25:54,6 --> 00:25:56,490
Mrs. Mckinney, why don't you
put down in writing

398
00:25:56,544 --> 00:25:58,846
Your little and loud complaints,
and I'll make sure

399
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:0,800
They get put
in the suggestion box.

400
00:26:4,543 --> 00:26:6,344
Jesus.

401
00:26:6,430 --> 00:26:8,631
You are
really somethin'.

402
00:26:8,684 --> 00:26:10,835
Thanks. I appreciate
the euphemism.

403
00:26:10,922 --> 00:26:13,173
I've always wanted
to be somethin'.

404
00:26:21,124 --> 00:26:23,125
Man: Can I help you
with something, miss?

405
00:26:23,178 --> 00:26:25,963
Oh. Uh, no.

406
00:26:36,153 --> 00:26:37,787
Mr. Thorsen! Hey!

407
00:26:37,824 --> 00:26:39,23
Hey, hold up, man.
Come on,

408
00:26:39,76 --> 00:26:40,660
I've been waiting
all day for you.

409
00:26:40,712 --> 00:26:42,863
Hey. Hey, why won't
you return my calls?

410
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:44,50
We're not friends.

411
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,536
You know, I got
the pink slip for the car,

412
00:26:45,588 --> 00:26:47,5
And that's quite
a stocking stuffer.

413
00:26:47,58 --> 00:26:48,425
Are you gonna tell me
you can't accept it?

414
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:49,978
No, no. That would
make me a moron.

415
00:26:50,13 --> 00:26:51,46
I just want to know
about these,

416
00:26:51,99 --> 00:26:52,399
Uh, these instructions
you left me.

417
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,385
Just do what they say.
Pay it forward.

418
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:55,405
Why?

419
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:56,390
Because you've
accepted the car.

420
00:26:56,443 --> 00:26:57,392
You're obligated.

421
00:26:57,445 --> 00:26:58,611
I'm obligated.

422
00:26:58,697 --> 00:26:59,864
Well, what if I don't
feel obligated, huh?

423
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:1,83
Well, what if I
just take my new car

424
00:27:1,168 --> 00:27:2,85
And get a couple hookers

425
00:27:2,170 --> 00:27:3,120
And drive down
to mexico?

426
00:27:3,205 --> 00:27:4,172
I'll never know.

427
00:27:4,207 --> 00:27:5,458
But you'll what--
what is this?

428
00:27:5,543 --> 00:27:6,543
Come on, for real.

429
00:27:6,595 --> 00:27:8,296
An attack
of total altruism

430
00:27:8,382 --> 00:27:9,382
From a litigator.

431
00:27:9,434 --> 00:27:10,601
I've got a meeting.

432
00:27:10,686 --> 00:27:12,971
I've got a story, ok?

433
00:27:13,57 --> 00:27:14,625
A senior partner
at channing and moss

434
00:27:14,711 --> 00:27:16,11
Is giving away new cars?

435
00:27:16,47 --> 00:27:17,580
You could tell me a reason,
or I could make one up.

436
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:19,518
Mine will be a lot more
interesting, I promise.

437
00:27:19,553 --> 00:27:20,954
You've gone dotty.
You're wearing crystals.

438
00:27:21,40 --> 00:27:24,242
You're keeping a few
too many cats at home, huh?

439
00:27:24,296 --> 00:27:27,365
All right. Look, all right?
Listen. Listen, please.

440
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,587
My ex-wife has
everything, ok? There.

441
00:27:29,673 --> 00:27:31,124
Plus she's
in a lesbian relationship,

442
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:32,743
I think,
just to piss me off.

443
00:27:32,796 --> 00:27:34,764
Help me out, please.

444
00:27:39,442 --> 00:27:43,812
My daughter has asthma.
One night, it was very bad,

445
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:45,618
The worst I'd ever seen it.

446
00:27:45,704 --> 00:27:47,205
It was the middle
of the night,

447
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,124
The emergency room.

448
00:27:49,211 --> 00:27:50,461
We were waiting forever.

449
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:52,80
Couldn't get anyone
to pay attention.

450
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:55,585
[man laughing]

451
00:28:2,353 --> 00:28:3,803
Her inhaler doesn't
seem to be working at all.

452
00:28:3,855 --> 00:28:5,789
Sorry. Mr. Parker.
What happened?

453
00:28:5,842 --> 00:28:7,643
My sister,
she stabbed me.

454
00:28:7,730 --> 00:28:8,646
I can't believe--

455
00:28:8,732 --> 00:28:9,982
Excuse me.
We were here first.

456
00:28:10,67 --> 00:28:11,368
I'm sorry, we have to go
with stab wounds first.

457
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:12,870
She can't breathe.
She's very scared.

458
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:13,957
Look,
I will let you know.

459
00:28:14,42 --> 00:28:14,992
Mr. Thorsen:
Somebody has to see her.

460
00:28:15,77 --> 00:28:15,944
Nurse: I'm sorry.
It's protocol.

461
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:17,780
It's never been
this bad.

462
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:18,765
You have
to do something.

463
00:28:18,851 --> 00:28:20,268
Sir, would you
just sit down?

464
00:28:20,354 --> 00:28:22,38
I'm sorry. We've
been here for 4 hours.

465
00:28:22,90 --> 00:28:24,8
You need
to get a doctor.

466
00:28:24,44 --> 00:28:26,946
No. No, wait.
Hey, no. No!

467
00:28:27,34 --> 00:28:28,734
Would you excuse me?
Excuse me.

468
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,237
That's bullshit. You need
to help her right now!

469
00:28:30,323 --> 00:28:31,390
Excuse me?

470
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:32,325
No. No, why you give
me all this shit?

471
00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:33,361
Ain't you got
some oxygen

472
00:28:33,413 --> 00:28:34,279
Or something
you can give her?

473
00:28:34,365 --> 00:28:35,615
Fine, let me--
no, no, no.

474
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,84
You don't need
to get no supervisor.

475
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:38,837
You're the supervisor
of the day. Huh?

476
00:28:38,873 --> 00:28:40,757
You are
the supervisor today.

477
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,278
You feel me on that?
Now, I want you to take

478
00:28:42,363 --> 00:28:43,613
Your skinny ass
down the hall,

479
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:45,700
Put the little girl
on a tray, and supervise her,

480
00:28:45,753 --> 00:28:48,371
And I want you to get her
some goddamn air!

481
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:49,942
I got your back, sis.

482
00:28:50,28 --> 00:28:51,445
Oh, bitch, you still here?!
Shit!

483
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,64
[gunshots]

484
00:28:53,117 --> 00:28:55,618
Oh, shit ain't funny,
now, is it?

485
00:28:55,705 --> 00:28:58,540
Come on, man! No! No, man!
This ain't fair, man!

486
00:28:58,594 --> 00:29:1,729
Come on! Come on, man!
There! There!

487
00:29:1,784 --> 00:29:3,201
Mr. Thorsen:
I thanked him,

488
00:29:3,253 --> 00:29:5,220
And there were some
very specific orifices

489
00:29:5,273 --> 00:29:7,441
In which I was told
to shove my thanks.

490
00:29:7,528 --> 00:29:9,829
He told me,
"just pay it forward."

491
00:29:9,865 --> 00:29:11,750
3 big favors
for 3 other people.

492
00:29:11,836 --> 00:29:12,936
That's it.

493
00:29:13,22 --> 00:29:15,156
So, it's like
a "pass it on" thing, then.

494
00:29:15,192 --> 00:29:16,576
Wait a minute.
You and this lowlife

495
00:29:16,662 --> 00:29:17,946
Were in this chain
of do-gooders?

496
00:29:18,32 --> 00:29:19,782
Some kind of mother teresa
conga line?

497
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:21,703
That's a little new agey
for you, isn't it?

498
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:22,788
Sort of tibetan?

499
00:29:22,874 --> 00:29:24,424
What, are you
in a cult?

500
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:26,595
If you mention
my name,

501
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:27,882
You'll be
selling your kidneys

502
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,601
To pay
for your lawsuit.

503
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:31,254
Cult.

504
00:29:31,307 --> 00:29:32,256
Hey. The guy--

505
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:34,226
What was
the guy's name?

506
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:38,66
Sorry. I'm late
for my mass wedding.

507
00:29:54,134 --> 00:29:57,420
[door squeaks]
[gasps]

508
00:29:57,474 --> 00:29:59,224
Hey!

509
00:30:5,423 --> 00:30:7,457
I know
somebody's in here.

510
00:30:7,510 --> 00:30:9,794
[clatter]
man: Oh.

511
00:30:9,848 --> 00:30:12,783
Arlene:
I know you're there.

512
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:14,505
I want you to come out,

513
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,424
Or I will find you
and shoot you, I swear--

514
00:30:16,477 --> 00:30:20,313
Please don't shoot.

515
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,735
Please.

516
00:30:21,771 --> 00:30:26,474
You stay right there.
If I see you move one--

517
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,462
[screams]

518
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:29,266
[rifle fires]

519
00:30:33,142 --> 00:30:34,593
Please don't
pick it up!

520
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:37,97
Please don't.
I'm not moving.

521
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:41,55
Please.

522
00:30:42,444 --> 00:30:44,728
What are you doin'
on my truck?

523
00:30:44,781 --> 00:30:48,951
Let me show you.
I'm just--

524
00:30:49,40 --> 00:30:52,75
I'm just gonna
open the door, ok?

525
00:30:55,252 --> 00:30:57,920
[engine starts]

526
00:31:2,550 --> 00:31:6,953
See, it might be easier
for you to sell now...

527
00:31:7,8 --> 00:31:8,258
Now that it works.

528
00:31:8,310 --> 00:31:9,460
I didn't ask
for your help.

529
00:31:9,512 --> 00:31:10,729
No.

530
00:31:10,765 --> 00:31:12,215
You been living
in my garage?

531
00:31:12,252 --> 00:31:14,269
No. Not after tonight.

532
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:16,973
Look, can I come around?
I just wanna--

533
00:31:17,60 --> 00:31:19,461
I got a handyman job
at the royal motel.

534
00:31:19,515 --> 00:31:20,464
They're giving me
a room.

535
00:31:20,517 --> 00:31:21,850
You just
stay right there.

536
00:31:21,936 --> 00:31:24,104
Please, I--I
don't like guns.

537
00:31:26,27 --> 00:31:28,312
What is going on
with you and my son?

538
00:31:28,365 --> 00:31:30,32
He wanted
to help somebody,

539
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,919
Wanted to get somebody
back on their feet,

540
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:34,90
So he gave me
a little money.

541
00:31:34,127 --> 00:31:35,460
He gave you money?

542
00:31:35,512 --> 00:31:36,879
Yes, ma'am.

543
00:31:36,965 --> 00:31:37,998
That's his savings.

544
00:31:38,50 --> 00:31:41,636
Uh, well,
it's clothes and shoes,

545
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,26
And I got the job
off it.

546
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:47,281
You think
you can keep it?

547
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,535
Looks to me like
you got yourself

548
00:31:48,621 --> 00:31:51,39
A little problem.

549
00:31:55,117 --> 00:31:56,517
I can lick it.

550
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,155
How's that supposed
to happen all of a sudden?

551
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:1,826
You ever
been on the street?

552
00:32:4,468 --> 00:32:6,52
My mom took us
pretty close.

553
00:32:6,138 --> 00:32:8,589
Well, you can't know.

554
00:32:8,677 --> 00:32:11,645
Not until you're
looking at a dumpster.

555
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:12,982
But when you climb
into that thing

556
00:32:13,18 --> 00:32:14,519
For the first time,

557
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:16,655
And you pull those
newspapers over you,

558
00:32:16,692 --> 00:32:20,661
That's when you know that
you've messed your life up.

559
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,601
Somebody comes along
like your son

560
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:25,723
And gives me a leg up,

561
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:28,261
I'll take it.

562
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:32,217
Even from a kid,
I'll take it.

563
00:32:32,272 --> 00:32:35,57
I...

564
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:38,879
I can't mess up again,
or I'll be dead.

565
00:32:38,935 --> 00:32:42,387
Look, I appreciate what
you're trying to do,

566
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:43,475
Paying back trevor--

567
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,927
I'm not allowed
to pay back trevor.

568
00:32:45,12 --> 00:32:46,713
Then what is it
you're doing?

569
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:49,685
I'm paying it forward.

570
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:54,58
I know
you want me to go.

571
00:32:54,114 --> 00:32:57,32
I'll go.

572
00:32:58,823 --> 00:33:1,374
What's paying it forward?

573
00:33:1,462 --> 00:33:3,746
That's me.

574
00:33:3,833 --> 00:33:8,52
That's me,
and that's 3 people...

575
00:33:10,428 --> 00:33:12,646
And I'm going
to help them,

576
00:33:12,683 --> 00:33:14,901
But it has to be
something really big,

577
00:33:14,987 --> 00:33:20,558
Something they can't
do by themselves...

578
00:33:20,614 --> 00:33:23,333
So I do it for them.

579
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:28,357
Then they do it
for 3 other people...

580
00:33:28,412 --> 00:33:30,864
That's 9...

581
00:33:30,918 --> 00:33:34,871
And I do 3 more.

582
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:39,545
That's 27, so, I'm
not really good at math,

583
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:42,887
But it gets big
really fast, you know?

584
00:33:42,941 --> 00:33:44,225
[all chattering]

585
00:33:44,277 --> 00:33:45,560
It's not gonna work.

586
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:50,885
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

587
00:33:50,939 --> 00:33:52,473
A little articulation,
please.

588
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,593
Yes.

589
00:33:53,645 --> 00:33:54,728
I think
it's a good idea.

590
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,698
Shawn?
It's stupid.

591
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:57,701
Eugene: Adam?

592
00:33:57,753 --> 00:33:58,786
It's the honor system.

593
00:33:58,872 --> 00:33:59,905
People blow off
the honor system.

594
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:0,840
So what?

595
00:34:0,875 --> 00:34:2,125
Just 'cause you do.

596
00:34:2,211 --> 00:34:5,63
Eugene: Well, trevor,
the class seems to think

597
00:34:5,116 --> 00:34:8,252
That you've come up with
an overly utopian idea.

598
00:34:8,339 --> 00:34:10,290
Look that word up
in a minute.

599
00:34:10,377 --> 00:34:14,563
Like a perfect world?

600
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:16,619
Mm-hmm.

601
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:20,458
So?

602
00:34:20,547 --> 00:34:25,768
So, what put this idea
in your head?

603
00:34:29,147 --> 00:34:30,96
'cause...

604
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:33,267
Everything sucks.

605
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,855
He talked to you
about this?

606
00:34:35,893 --> 00:34:40,596
We've had
our discussions. Yeah.

607
00:34:40,652 --> 00:34:42,369
But you don't
have to worry, though,

608
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:43,906
'cause I'll just--
I'll tell him

609
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,558
We can't talk no more.

610
00:34:45,611 --> 00:34:48,397
No, um, don't do that.

611
00:34:50,237 --> 00:34:52,571
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

612
00:34:55,697 --> 00:34:56,814
Yes, ma'am.

613
00:34:56,899 --> 00:34:58,950
Ok.

614
00:35:7,637 --> 00:35:10,672
Boy: I call the president,
like, to talk about pollution,

615
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,511
But my mom said now they're
gonna put us on some list,

616
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,616
So she hung up.
[kids laugh]

617
00:35:15,669 --> 00:35:18,471
For this assignment,
I put up recycling flyers

618
00:35:18,558 --> 00:35:20,8
At 2 supermarkets.

619
00:35:20,95 --> 00:35:22,229
I'm gonna put up
this website in chinese

620
00:35:22,265 --> 00:35:23,933
That's gonna tell
all the kids in china

621
00:35:23,985 --> 00:35:25,602
To jump up and down
at the same time.

622
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:35,303
The goal being to knock
the earth off its axis.

623
00:35:35,357 --> 00:35:36,307
Yeah.

624
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:37,309
Thank you.
Sit down, shawn.

625
00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:39,295
[laughter]

626
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:42,184
Well, your ideas
are as surprising

627
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,771
As they are variegated.

628
00:35:43,824 --> 00:35:44,990
Add that
to your list of words

629
00:35:45,76 --> 00:35:46,943
To look up
this evening.

630
00:35:46,996 --> 00:35:48,163
But I want to focus
for a moment

631
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:50,750
On one project
we heard today,

632
00:35:50,787 --> 00:35:53,288
Because I've been
teaching for many years,

633
00:35:53,341 --> 00:35:55,325
And it really is
the first new idea

634
00:35:55,378 --> 00:35:59,715
That also requires
an extreme act of faith

635
00:35:59,804 --> 00:36:1,938
In the goodness of people.

636
00:36:1,974 --> 00:36:7,195
Trevor has made an attempt
to interact with the world,

637
00:36:7,285 --> 00:36:9,152
And that was the assignment,

638
00:36:9,205 --> 00:36:11,22
And if I were
an effusive person

639
00:36:11,76 --> 00:36:15,396
Given to easy praise,
I would call that...

640
00:36:15,484 --> 00:36:17,268
Admirable.

641
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:19,606
Now, here are the words
from today.

642
00:36:19,642 --> 00:36:22,144
Utopian, enigma, quantum.
I'm gonna add variegated.

643
00:36:22,197 --> 00:36:23,147
I want you
to go home tonight--

644
00:36:28,476 --> 00:36:29,442
Hey, mr. Simonet.

645
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,862
Hello.

646
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:42,967
Were you
just being nice?

647
00:36:43,3 --> 00:36:45,138
About what?

648
00:36:45,174 --> 00:36:48,93
About my idea.

649
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,682
Do you think it's good,
or were you just...

650
00:36:50,736 --> 00:36:51,986
Being teachery?

651
00:36:52,21 --> 00:36:54,489
Teachery?

652
00:36:54,526 --> 00:36:56,660
Bullshitting.

653
00:36:56,697 --> 00:37:1,66
Do I strike you
as someone falsely nice?

654
00:37:1,122 --> 00:37:5,775
No. You're not even
really all that nice.

655
00:37:8,536 --> 00:37:9,753
Well, it was a slip-up,

656
00:37:9,838 --> 00:37:12,874
And it will
not happen again.

657
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:19,54
What?

658
00:37:21,378 --> 00:37:23,379
What happened
to your face?

659
00:37:40,732 --> 00:37:43,533
Did you draw the short
straw today, trevor?

660
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,288
It's not
a very pertinent subject

661
00:37:46,376 --> 00:37:48,410
To social studies,
is it?

662
00:37:48,463 --> 00:37:50,547
You can go back and
tell them that's what I said.

663
00:37:50,584 --> 00:37:52,752
Tell who?

664
00:37:52,805 --> 00:37:53,805
See you tomorrow.

665
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,306
Do you know
where jerry is?

666
00:38:20,391 --> 00:38:22,558
Over there,
at the gate.

667
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:48,92
[knock on door]

668
00:38:53,138 --> 00:38:54,521
[knocking]

669
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:56,307
It's more product.

670
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,861
Man: Who is it?

671
00:38:57,946 --> 00:39:3,618
Trevor: It's trevor.
I'm looking for jerry.

672
00:39:3,657 --> 00:39:6,576
Jerry's not here.

673
00:39:6,663 --> 00:39:8,797
Trevor: When
will he be back?

674
00:39:8,834 --> 00:39:13,337
Man: He's not coming back.
Now get outta here.

675
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:20,321
Jerry?

676
00:39:20,356 --> 00:39:24,493
Man: Get outta here!

677
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:27,116
Please come out, jerry.

678
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:47,821
I remember 1976.
There were those programs

679
00:40:47,908 --> 00:40:51,260
In the school system.
Now it's--all that's gone.

680
00:40:51,314 --> 00:40:53,799
Man: I gotta go.

681
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:55,153
Trevor.

682
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:56,956
You ran out of class
this morning very fast.

683
00:40:57,8 --> 00:40:58,426
I wanted to talk to you.

684
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:21,118
[school bell rings]

685
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:45,165
[knock on door]

686
00:41:50,227 --> 00:41:52,44
Hello.

687
00:41:52,98 --> 00:41:53,148
Hello.

688
00:41:53,183 --> 00:41:55,184
Come in.

689
00:42:1,900 --> 00:42:3,868
Trevor's not feeling good.
He's in his room.

690
00:42:3,954 --> 00:42:6,305
Oh, I'm sorry.
What's the matter?

691
00:42:6,358 --> 00:42:7,976
Just a tummyache.

692
00:42:8,29 --> 00:42:9,446
Do you want to come in?

693
00:42:9,481 --> 00:42:13,150
Sure.
[clears throat]

694
00:42:13,206 --> 00:42:16,958
Uh, sit down.
Thank you.

695
00:42:16,996 --> 00:42:18,413
It's a very
beautiful home.

696
00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:19,416
Thank you.

697
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:20,868
Have, uh,
you lived in vegas

698
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,754
Your whole life?
Yeah.

699
00:42:29,403 --> 00:42:30,887
I was surprised
you wanted to do this.

700
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:32,657
I told him if you
wanted to talk to me,

701
00:42:32,693 --> 00:42:34,360
I would come
to the school.

702
00:42:34,412 --> 00:42:38,949
Mrs. Mckinney,
I didn't ask to see you.

703
00:42:39,39 --> 00:42:41,590
Well,
trevor said you did.

704
00:42:41,677 --> 00:42:45,680
Yeah, and he gave me
a note from you...

705
00:42:45,718 --> 00:42:48,252
Which you didn't write.

706
00:42:48,306 --> 00:42:50,724
He gave you
a note from me?

707
00:42:52,731 --> 00:42:55,265
Oh, god,
that's horrible.

708
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,404
He's been so--
no, I didn't mean you.

709
00:42:57,457 --> 00:42:58,858
Oh, no explanation
required. I'll go.

710
00:42:58,893 --> 00:42:59,860
I didn't mean you.

711
00:42:59,895 --> 00:43:1,29
No, you don't have to--

712
00:43:1,64 --> 00:43:3,949
Hey, it's not personal.
Would you stop?

713
00:43:4,37 --> 00:43:7,39
Can we just rewind here
a little bit?

714
00:43:7,76 --> 00:43:11,946
I obviously didn't realize
how much trevor likes you.

715
00:43:12,2 --> 00:43:14,553
Well, that's nothing
that we can't discuss

716
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:15,790
On parent-teacher night.

717
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,627
Then why did you come?

718
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:20,982
Why did you come here?
Why didn't you just tell me

719
00:43:21,69 --> 00:43:22,736
To come to the school?

720
00:43:25,912 --> 00:43:28,813
Because you came
to the school

721
00:43:28,868 --> 00:43:30,452
To talk to me
about your son,

722
00:43:30,504 --> 00:43:33,706
And I behaved
like a...

723
00:43:33,793 --> 00:43:36,45
An asshole?

724
00:43:36,131 --> 00:43:39,884
Sorry. Is that
too trailer trash

725
00:43:39,972 --> 00:43:40,972
A word for you?

726
00:43:41,24 --> 00:43:44,727
How does rat bastard
sit with you?

727
00:43:44,814 --> 00:43:46,231
That's pretty good.

728
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:47,501
Dickhead?

729
00:43:47,553 --> 00:43:48,770
Oh, I like that.
[laughs]

730
00:43:52,145 --> 00:43:53,112
Look, I'm...

731
00:44:4,318 --> 00:44:10,357
I, um, I made
all this food.

732
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,732
It's just
sittin' here, um...

733
00:44:16,643 --> 00:44:20,529
I really don't know
who else to talk to about him.

734
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:23,352
Mmm. This is good.

735
00:44:23,405 --> 00:44:24,823
Thanks.

736
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:26,659
I don't understand.
This is summer school?

737
00:44:26,728 --> 00:44:28,579
Uh-huh.

738
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,583
Why do you think
trevor stopped talking?

739
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:35,707
I don't know.
He seems mad.

740
00:44:35,797 --> 00:44:37,631
Well, seventh grade
is difficult,

741
00:44:37,666 --> 00:44:39,300
But he seems
very happy at school.

742
00:44:39,336 --> 00:44:43,590
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe it's fine.

743
00:44:43,678 --> 00:44:45,378
How much
do you see him?

744
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,66
As much as I can.

745
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,235
How much is that?

746
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,722
No, I'm not doin'
a bunch of skanky guys

747
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:53,694
Instead of spending time
with my son, ok?

748
00:44:53,747 --> 00:44:56,532
I got 2 jobs.

749
00:44:56,586 --> 00:45:0,789
Right. I meant that.

750
00:45:0,878 --> 00:45:4,214
Couldn't have just
been a question.

751
00:45:6,889 --> 00:45:8,389
Uh, mrs. Mckinney,
do you think

752
00:45:8,442 --> 00:45:9,693
There might
be something,

753
00:45:9,728 --> 00:45:11,896
Um, I don't know,
outside of school

754
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:13,650
That might
be bothering him?

755
00:45:13,736 --> 00:45:17,239
I don't know.

756
00:45:19,63 --> 00:45:20,630
Ok, you know, I'm
gonna have to consult

757
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:22,449
My spirit guides here,
because you tell me

758
00:45:22,503 --> 00:45:23,786
That trevor's
withholding from you,

759
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:25,573
But you won't tell me
anything specific,

760
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:26,842
And you still
want me to sit here

761
00:45:26,928 --> 00:45:27,978
And divine why.

762
00:45:28,63 --> 00:45:32,183
Divine why?
You always talk like that?

763
00:45:32,272 --> 00:45:33,222
Yes.

764
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,558
You go to some
big, fancy school?

765
00:45:35,628 --> 00:45:38,29
Yes.

766
00:45:38,116 --> 00:45:40,284
Think you could stop
rubbing my nose in it?

767
00:45:46,299 --> 00:45:47,799
Is there a father?

768
00:45:47,851 --> 00:45:50,386
He doesn't
live here anymore.

769
00:45:50,473 --> 00:45:52,524
I don't know
where he is.

770
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:54,528
Yeah. I know
what that's like.

771
00:45:54,614 --> 00:45:55,697
[knock on door]

772
00:45:55,784 --> 00:45:57,801
Bonnie: Arlene,
I've called you 5 times.

773
00:45:57,853 --> 00:45:59,137
Did you slip or what?

774
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:0,357
Bonnie.
No, listen,

775
00:46:0,442 --> 00:46:1,943
You don't call your sponsor
once in a while,

776
00:46:1,978 --> 00:46:2,945
You don't
have a sponsor.

777
00:46:2,980 --> 00:46:4,180
Bonnie!
What?

778
00:46:4,232 --> 00:46:7,218
Arlene: This
is eugene simonet.

779
00:46:7,305 --> 00:46:9,723
You're not supposed
to date for a year.

780
00:46:9,811 --> 00:46:10,711
Arlene:
This isn't a date.

781
00:46:10,795 --> 00:46:11,995
No, I'm--I'm
trevor's teacher.

782
00:46:12,48 --> 00:46:12,998
It isn't. It's--

783
00:46:13,50 --> 00:46:14,84
We're having
a conference,

784
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:16,987
And, uh, we were
through. We're done.

785
00:46:17,41 --> 00:46:18,858
Arlene: We're done.

786
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:37,661
[sighs]

787
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:39,330
How could you
do that to me?

788
00:46:39,384 --> 00:46:42,86
Write a letter to him?
Sign my name?

789
00:46:42,122 --> 00:46:43,789
Why'd you have
to mess everything up?

790
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,626
Oh, no.
I didn't mess this up.

791
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:46,629
What were you doing,

792
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:47,631
Just standing
at the door

793
00:46:47,683 --> 00:46:49,134
Listening to everything?

794
00:46:49,186 --> 00:46:50,470
What happened
to your stomachache?

795
00:46:50,522 --> 00:46:52,139
What do you care?
You always lie.

796
00:46:52,192 --> 00:46:53,726
Trevor, this
wasn't my fault.

797
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,145
This whole thing
was embarrassing.

798
00:46:55,198 --> 00:46:57,282
I did something good,
and you don't even know it.

799
00:46:57,318 --> 00:47:0,387
Honey, listen.

800
00:47:0,474 --> 00:47:2,174
You can't just put
2 people together

801
00:47:2,228 --> 00:47:3,177
And make 'em
like each other.

802
00:47:3,230 --> 00:47:4,397
It doesn't work
that way.

803
00:47:4,482 --> 00:47:6,983
You only like people
you can get drunk with.

804
00:47:9,292 --> 00:47:10,709
You're just waiting
for him to come back.

805
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:11,711
No, I'm not.

806
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:13,46
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.

807
00:47:13,132 --> 00:47:14,416
Yes, you are!
No, I'm not!

808
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:15,501
Your father's
not gettin'

809
00:47:15,553 --> 00:47:16,503
His foot
through--

810
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:17,505
That's what
you always say.

811
00:47:17,557 --> 00:47:18,507
Well, I mean it now.

812
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:19,592
You always mean it.

813
00:47:19,678 --> 00:47:20,895
What do you
want me to say?

814
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,664
I say it, I mean it.
I mean it now.

815
00:47:22,717 --> 00:47:23,917
Not when he's around.
When he's around,

816
00:47:24,3 --> 00:47:25,53
You don't care
what happens to me.

817
00:47:25,138 --> 00:47:26,422
You don't ev--
you don't even know

818
00:47:26,507 --> 00:47:27,591
I'm in the same house.

819
00:47:27,677 --> 00:47:28,594
That's not true.
It is true.

820
00:47:28,678 --> 00:47:29,761
You know--
it's true.

821
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:31,732
Listen, I love you.

822
00:47:31,818 --> 00:47:32,901
I love you.

823
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:34,487
I'm doing
the best I can.

824
00:47:34,523 --> 00:47:35,857
I don't want you
to love me.

825
00:47:35,909 --> 00:47:37,576
I hate the way you look.
I hate the way you smell.

826
00:47:37,663 --> 00:47:38,563
I hate the way you are.

827
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:39,598
I hate that
you're my mother.

828
00:49:24,34 --> 00:49:26,118
Trev?

829
00:49:29,962 --> 00:49:31,746
Trev, I'm gonna
come in, ok?

830
00:49:42,185 --> 00:49:44,603
He said that an hour ago.

831
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:49,727
Do--do you understand
my kid is missing?

832
00:49:49,783 --> 00:49:53,536
If I had a car,
I'd be out looking for him!

833
00:49:56,96 --> 00:49:58,580
[ring]

834
00:50:0,204 --> 00:50:1,954
[ring]

835
00:50:5,597 --> 00:50:7,799
What time do you
think he took off?

836
00:50:7,885 --> 00:50:11,587
I don't know.
I'm sorry to do this to you.

837
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:13,810
Bonnie wasn't home,
the cops wouldn't come...

838
00:50:13,896 --> 00:50:15,63
It's ok.

839
00:50:15,115 --> 00:50:16,465
And I would have called
one of my friends,

840
00:50:16,552 --> 00:50:17,468
But my friends
are all drunks...

841
00:50:17,554 --> 00:50:19,888
It's ok.
And so am I.

842
00:50:19,941 --> 00:50:22,59
I'm a drunk, too.

843
00:50:25,685 --> 00:50:27,269
I believe some
people refer to that

844
00:50:27,356 --> 00:50:28,556
As "in recovery."

845
00:50:37,275 --> 00:50:39,893
Where you going?

846
00:51:5,345 --> 00:51:7,313
Hey. You got enough?

847
00:51:7,399 --> 00:51:9,767
You need
a ticket somewhere?

848
00:51:9,820 --> 00:51:12,239
How much? Hmm?
Come with me.

849
00:51:12,275 --> 00:51:13,442
I'll get you there.

850
00:51:13,494 --> 00:51:15,862
I'll get you a ticket,
you son of a bitch.

851
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:16,949
Honey, are you ok?

852
00:51:18,37 --> 00:51:20,622
Man: Oh! Aah!

853
00:51:38,175 --> 00:51:39,675
Trev, for the rest
of my life,

854
00:51:39,762 --> 00:51:41,495
I could never be as
sorry about anything

855
00:51:41,548 --> 00:51:43,515
As I am for
what I did to you.

856
00:51:52,68 --> 00:51:54,320
I didn't drink.

857
00:51:54,373 --> 00:51:56,791
I wanted to,
but I didn't.

858
00:52:6,62 --> 00:52:9,64
You got no reason
to trust me...

859
00:52:9,151 --> 00:52:10,769
And I know you
don't want to hear

860
00:52:10,854 --> 00:52:13,239
Any more promises,

861
00:52:13,326 --> 00:52:15,911
So I'm just gonna
tell you the truth.

862
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,571
I have a problem.

863
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:25,761
I have a really bad
problem.

864
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,268
I gotta stop.

865
00:52:31,143 --> 00:52:33,261
And if you can
be with me on this,

866
00:52:33,314 --> 00:52:36,266
If you can think
it's possible

867
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,105
That I can do it...

868
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:43,546
Then I think
maybe I can...

869
00:52:43,584 --> 00:52:45,802
If you just...

870
00:52:45,889 --> 00:52:49,475
Try a little bit,
and I'll try.

871
00:53:11,638 --> 00:53:13,22
Arlene:
You're still here.

872
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:14,274
Oh, yeah.
I hope it's ok.

873
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,610
I just wanted
to make sure--

874
00:53:15,645 --> 00:53:17,546
He's asleep.
Good, ok.

875
00:53:17,633 --> 00:53:19,100
How did you know
where he was?

876
00:53:19,136 --> 00:53:21,855
Oh. Well, kids,
they either hitchhike,

877
00:53:21,941 --> 00:53:22,974
Or they take a bus.

878
00:53:23,26 --> 00:53:24,360
Listen, um--

879
00:53:24,445 --> 00:53:25,612
For what?

880
00:53:25,649 --> 00:53:28,150
Well, what?
Wait, give me a shot--

881
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:29,821
No, you don't have to.
I--I understand--

882
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,790
Wait! God damn,
I want to thank you.

883
00:53:34,632 --> 00:53:35,999
Thank you.

884
00:53:36,51 --> 00:53:37,51
You're welcome.

885
00:53:37,137 --> 00:53:38,337
[laughs]

886
00:53:40,643 --> 00:53:42,94
Wasn't quite worth it,
was it?

887
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,647
No.

888
00:53:43,683 --> 00:53:44,816
Listen,
I was wondering,

889
00:53:44,852 --> 00:53:47,520
Do you want to come
back here sometime?

890
00:53:47,574 --> 00:53:49,775
Have dinner with me?

891
00:53:53,703 --> 00:53:59,90
I'm not entirely sure
that would be appropriate.

892
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:2,415
Ok. I understand.

893
00:54:2,469 --> 00:54:5,21
Good night.
Good night.

894
00:54:15,912 --> 00:54:18,580
Ok. Why'd you do that man
the favor, sidney?

895
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:21,786
No, it's, like,
3 favors, player.

896
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,624
You gotta do 3.

897
00:54:23,676 --> 00:54:24,643
Now I'll do
the other 2

898
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:26,396
Up in here
for my folks.

899
00:54:26,432 --> 00:54:27,399
You know,
a lot of brothers

900
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:28,401
Need favors in here.

901
00:54:28,436 --> 00:54:29,937
Who told you
to do it?

902
00:54:29,989 --> 00:54:34,108
[sighs]

903
00:54:34,163 --> 00:54:36,782
It's, like,
this idea I got.

904
00:54:37,787 --> 00:54:39,671
Yo, you gonna
put this on tv?

905
00:54:39,757 --> 00:54:43,593
Wait. How did you come up
with an idea like that?

906
00:54:43,632 --> 00:54:46,333
Man, it's like...

907
00:54:46,387 --> 00:54:48,771
It's like the world
is a shit hole.

908
00:54:48,808 --> 00:54:50,692
I mean, excuse my french
and shit, right?

909
00:54:50,778 --> 00:54:52,696
And it's like...

910
00:54:52,782 --> 00:54:55,183
I just thought,
like, boom!

911
00:54:55,237 --> 00:54:58,155
Like the whole shit
could be, like, better.

912
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:2,298
Didn't start
with anyone else?

913
00:55:2,334 --> 00:55:4,969
No, nigger. That shit
came from here, all right?

914
00:55:5,6 --> 00:55:6,556
The shit came from my head.

915
00:55:6,642 --> 00:55:7,843
I mean, I can't lie
to you, man,

916
00:55:7,895 --> 00:55:8,928
I-I've been through--

917
00:55:9,14 --> 00:55:13,50
Through some
heavy-ass shit...

918
00:55:13,105 --> 00:55:16,24
But not no more, I mean,
'cause it changed me...

919
00:55:16,78 --> 00:55:17,728
And I'm changing
this place, man.

920
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,699
I mean, people
are listening to me.

921
00:55:20,753 --> 00:55:24,622
People are staying clean.
[laughs]

922
00:55:24,711 --> 00:55:28,964
I mean--I mean, it's like
some cosmic aristotle shit.

923
00:55:29,53 --> 00:55:29,969
You feel me?

924
00:55:30,55 --> 00:55:31,922
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

925
00:55:31,974 --> 00:55:33,758
Yeah, no doubt.
I feel ya.

926
00:55:33,811 --> 00:55:36,96
No doubt, dog.
No doubt.

927
00:55:36,149 --> 00:55:39,768
The thing is,
sidney, um...

928
00:55:39,823 --> 00:55:42,658
Somebody else is saying
that "pay it forward"

929
00:55:42,745 --> 00:55:44,596
Was their idea.

930
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:47,503
Who?

931
00:55:51,11 --> 00:55:53,12
I think you know who.

932
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:56,853
That bitch.

933
00:55:56,939 --> 00:55:59,107
No. No. She
a lyin'-ass bitch, man,

934
00:55:59,161 --> 00:56:0,244
I'm telling you.

935
00:56:0,279 --> 00:56:1,980
She's a lyin' bitch.
She got your head.

936
00:56:2,32 --> 00:56:3,282
I'm telling you.
Ok.

937
00:56:3,334 --> 00:56:4,651
Hey, she makes a pretty
good case, though, sid.

938
00:56:4,704 --> 00:56:6,422
That old
crusty bag lady?

939
00:56:6,457 --> 00:56:8,258
I'm telling you, man,
this is all from me,

940
00:56:8,294 --> 00:56:9,428
All from my heart, dog.

941
00:56:9,463 --> 00:56:10,830
Ok. She said--sidney.
What?

942
00:56:10,882 --> 00:56:12,16
Listen to me.
It doesn't matter

943
00:56:12,101 --> 00:56:13,334
If you got it from
the old lady or not,

944
00:56:13,388 --> 00:56:14,337
'cause you're the one
paying it forward.

945
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:15,339
You damn right.

946
00:56:15,392 --> 00:56:16,525
In prison, no less.

947
00:56:16,611 --> 00:56:19,396
The parole board
will eat that up, sidney.

948
00:56:19,482 --> 00:56:20,616
Oh, the parole board?

949
00:56:20,651 --> 00:56:22,185
The parole board.

950
00:56:22,238 --> 00:56:26,741
[laughs] oh, snap, yo.
You good, man.

951
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:29,298
Like a little carrot
for the mouse and shit.

952
00:56:29,334 --> 00:56:32,86
[laughs]
no doubt, no doubt.

953
00:56:32,174 --> 00:56:33,174
It's too bad
my parole

954
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:34,392
Don't come up for
another year, b.

955
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:35,478
[pounds table with fist]

956
00:56:37,834 --> 00:56:39,535
What if I could make it

957
00:56:39,588 --> 00:56:41,639
So your parole
comes up next month?

958
00:57:59,842 --> 00:58:1,576
Arlene: Hello.

959
00:58:2,715 --> 00:58:5,800
Oh. Hello.

960
00:58:5,887 --> 00:58:8,639
Did you know
I worked here?

961
00:58:8,726 --> 00:58:12,261
No, I didn't.
Really.

962
00:58:12,316 --> 00:58:16,520
So you just dropped in
for a little game of craps?

963
00:58:16,608 --> 00:58:21,829
No. I, uh, I like
the coffee shop.

964
00:58:21,918 --> 00:58:25,371
They--they
have good food.

965
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:28,994
Yeah. They got
good pancakes.

966
00:58:29,48 --> 00:58:33,635
Yeah. Fluffy.

967
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:35,441
Do you want me

968
00:58:35,477 --> 00:58:37,111
To bring you
back something?

969
00:58:37,148 --> 00:58:39,866
Oh, no, thanks.
I get off in an hour.

970
00:58:39,952 --> 00:58:41,987
Oh, really?

971
00:58:42,40 --> 00:58:44,124
Yeah, really.

972
00:58:46,415 --> 00:58:47,465
Well--

973
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,302
Well, if you were
gonna eat anyway,

974
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:51,723
Then,

975
00:58:51,809 --> 00:58:55,728
If you, if you
wanted, maybe,

976
00:58:55,817 --> 00:58:59,903
If you were
hungry, we could--

977
00:58:59,991 --> 00:59:1,776
We could, if you,
if you were,

978
00:59:1,861 --> 00:59:3,829
If you wanted...

979
00:59:5,702 --> 00:59:11,6
Eat something...
Sometime.

980
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:17,55
7-iron, please.

981
00:59:17,108 --> 00:59:18,725
Yes, sir.

982
00:59:30,383 --> 00:59:31,717
Can I help you?

983
00:59:32,888 --> 00:59:35,589
No, I am not stalking
the governor, jordy.

984
00:59:35,643 --> 00:59:38,228
Shit. Chandler.

985
00:59:38,281 --> 00:59:40,582
You scared me.

986
00:59:40,636 --> 00:59:42,303
You look like crap.
What are you doing out here?

987
00:59:42,389 --> 00:59:43,473
I want to talk
to him, jordan.

988
00:59:43,558 --> 00:59:45,142
Heh! Your questions
piss him off.

989
00:59:45,229 --> 00:59:46,312
Oh, is that why
I got the bounce?

990
00:59:46,397 --> 00:59:47,314
He won't talk to you.

991
00:59:47,399 --> 00:59:48,316
Well, tell him
I'm a candygram.

992
00:59:48,401 --> 00:59:49,485
Stop it.

993
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:50,654
I got a better idea.
Why don't I tell him

994
00:59:50,739 --> 00:59:51,989
I've been sitting on
a story for 2 years

995
00:59:52,75 --> 00:59:53,158
About a little
party he had.

996
00:59:53,244 --> 00:59:55,78
The cleanup crew
found syringes,

997
00:59:55,131 --> 00:59:56,715
Si 12 1/2
high heels,

998
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:57,783
Animal droppings.

999
00:59:57,835 --> 00:59:59,336
That can't
be right, can it?

1000
00:59:59,422 --> 01:00:1,674
[laughs] if you
really had this,

1001
01:00:1,760 --> 01:00:2,677
You'd have used it.

1002
01:00:2,762 --> 01:00:3,896
Bullshit.

1003
01:00:3,931 --> 01:00:5,131
His friends in high
places had me kill it,

1004
01:00:5,183 --> 01:00:6,350
But ever since
I got fired,

1005
01:00:6,435 --> 01:00:8,103
I'm really not feeling
that loyal, you know?

1006
01:00:9,441 --> 01:00:10,525
What do you want?

1007
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:11,694
$4 million.

1008
01:00:11,779 --> 01:00:13,530
[scoffs]

1009
01:00:13,616 --> 01:00:15,951
I'm kidding, man.
Relax.

1010
01:00:16,4 --> 01:00:17,37
Ha ha ha!

1011
01:00:17,123 --> 01:00:18,540
Nothing, man.
A phone call.

1012
01:00:18,625 --> 01:00:19,625
I just need
a little phone call.

1013
01:00:19,677 --> 01:00:20,877
I need a massage

1014
01:00:20,964 --> 01:00:22,548
For a friend of
mine's parole date.

1015
01:00:22,633 --> 01:00:23,600
That's it.

1016
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:31,47
God, trevor.
They kept me 40 minutes over.

1017
01:00:31,133 --> 01:00:32,500
Did you call him?

1018
01:00:32,552 --> 01:00:33,719
I couldn't remember the name
of the stupid restaurant.

1019
01:00:33,804 --> 01:00:34,721
I remember the name
of the hotel.

1020
01:00:34,806 --> 01:00:35,723
I couldn't remember the n--

1021
01:00:35,808 --> 01:00:36,808
He hates people
being late.

1022
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,727
If you're late,
he thinks it means

1023
01:00:37,812 --> 01:00:39,63
You don't
respect him.

1024
01:00:39,148 --> 01:00:40,115
What?

1025
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:41,567
If you're late,
he'll think

1026
01:00:41,654 --> 01:00:43,571
It means you
don't respect him.

1027
01:00:51,656 --> 01:00:52,689
Well, I don't know.
Are you wearing this?

1028
01:00:52,741 --> 01:00:53,858
No. I want to wear
the green dress.

1029
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:55,461
You look like
a vampire in that.

1030
01:00:55,497 --> 01:00:57,364
Uhh. I gotta
take a shower.

1031
01:00:57,417 --> 01:00:58,366
What?

1032
01:00:58,419 --> 01:00:59,535
I smell horrible.

1033
01:00:59,587 --> 01:01:1,472
No, you don't.
No, you smell good.

1034
01:01:1,508 --> 01:01:2,975
You smell like, uh,
roses or something.

1035
01:01:3,11 --> 01:01:3,977
Let me just wash

1036
01:01:4,13 --> 01:01:5,146
Under my arms
really quick.

1037
01:01:5,182 --> 01:01:6,149
Are you sure?

1038
01:01:6,183 --> 01:01:7,350
Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure.

1039
01:01:16,871 --> 01:01:19,89
Trevor: Oh, wait.
Don't interrupt him

1040
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,92
When he's in the middle
of a sentence.

1041
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:21,260
He doesn't
like that, either.

1042
01:01:21,346 --> 01:01:22,846
What am I supposed to do,
raise my hand?

1043
01:01:22,883 --> 01:01:24,16
Get me my shoes, ok?
No.

1044
01:01:24,52 --> 01:01:25,18
Those little sandals.

1045
01:01:25,54 --> 01:01:26,87
These.

1046
01:01:26,139 --> 01:01:27,22
No, no, no.
I'm not wearing those.

1047
01:01:27,58 --> 01:01:28,24
They're way too sexy.

1048
01:01:28,60 --> 01:01:29,527
You're too late.
You owe him.

1049
01:01:29,562 --> 01:01:32,781
I owe him?
Who are you?

1050
01:01:34,405 --> 01:01:36,990
Oh, and none of
those stupid jokes.

1051
01:01:37,77 --> 01:01:38,377
He's not that kind
of person, ok?

1052
01:01:38,412 --> 01:01:39,379
Thank you
very much.

1053
01:01:39,414 --> 01:01:40,381
Where's
the phone?

1054
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:41,783
I gotta call
for a cab.

1055
01:01:41,835 --> 01:01:42,785
If I take a bus,

1056
01:01:42,837 --> 01:01:43,787
It might be
another hour,

1057
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:44,789
And I'm late.
No. Mom. Mom.

1058
01:01:44,841 --> 01:01:46,425
I got a call in
to the cabbie.

1059
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:48,45
I gotta call for a cab.

1060
01:01:48,81 --> 01:01:50,365
Duh.

1061
01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:52,69
Oh, my god.

1062
01:01:53,74 --> 01:01:55,292
Oh, my god.
You're a champ.

1063
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,295
Ok. Ok, mom.

1064
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,464
You're
the greatest kid on--

1065
01:01:57,549 --> 01:01:59,133
Ok, mom. Ok, mom. Ok.

1066
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:0,586
You have to go.
You have to go, ok?

1067
01:02:0,639 --> 01:02:1,922
Oh, here, here, here.

1068
01:02:1,974 --> 01:02:3,642
Go. Go.

1069
01:02:3,728 --> 01:02:4,828
Lock both doors.

1070
01:02:4,914 --> 01:02:6,331
I will.

1071
01:02:6,416 --> 01:02:8,300
[arlene talks
to cabdriver]

1072
01:02:8,387 --> 01:02:9,320
I love you!

1073
01:02:9,405 --> 01:02:11,240
Love you, too, mom.

1074
01:02:35,689 --> 01:02:37,840
I respect you!

1075
01:02:38,879 --> 01:02:39,962
I respect you.

1076
01:02:40,47 --> 01:02:41,264
They kept me
late at work,

1077
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:42,466
And then I got on the bus
to go home and change,

1078
01:02:42,553 --> 01:02:43,519
Which was stupid.

1079
01:02:43,554 --> 01:02:44,470
That was my fault,
and I'm sorry,

1080
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:45,723
But I was

1081
01:02:47,228 --> 01:02:49,396
You're

[whispers]
I'm sorry.

1083
01:03:4,345 --> 01:03:6,212
[jail cell door bangs]

1084
01:03:20,442 --> 01:03:21,976
So I'm, like, living
in vegas, right, man?

1085
01:03:22,28 --> 01:03:23,112
And one night,

1086
01:03:23,164 --> 01:03:24,314
I was walking
down the street, right?

1087
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:25,449
I'm just minding my own.

1088
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:26,585
Brother wasn't doing
nothing to nobody.

1089
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:29,5
I mean, I was just
on my way to church.

1090
01:03:30,77 --> 01:03:32,461
Just out of nowhere, man,

1091
01:03:32,549 --> 01:03:34,783
Just--just 5 bloods
just peeled out of a truck,

1092
01:03:34,836 --> 01:03:36,971
And one of 'em, man,
was real black.

1093
01:03:37,57 --> 01:03:38,408
Hey!

1094
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:39,860
Man, I started
swinging one by one,

1095
01:03:39,896 --> 01:03:41,447
Like, nigger, take that.
Ba ba ba ba ba,

Like ali on the bitches,

1097
01:03:42,851 --> 01:03:45,536
And I was like what, what,
what, what's up, nigger?

1098
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:46,874
What's up? Bam, bam.

[sirens]

1100
01:03:48,329 --> 01:03:49,896
And then all
five of them got up

1101
01:03:49,982 --> 01:03:51,399
And started
chasing me, man,

1102
01:03:51,485 --> 01:03:52,385
They're like,
"we gonna kill you, bitch.

1103
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:53,637
We gonna kill you, bitch,"

1104
01:03:53,672 --> 01:03:55,89
And I was like,
"you can't catch me, blood.

1105
01:03:55,176 --> 01:03:56,426
You can't catch me, blood."

1106
01:03:56,511 --> 01:4:0,47
Then, man, all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

1107
01:04:0,101 --> 01:04:2,653
That's when I ran
into this old lady.

1108
01:04:2,690 --> 01:04:4,557
That's who you want
to know about.

Shoot. I smell better

Yeah. All right.

1129
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:45,516
All right. So, what?
What you want?

1130
01:05:45,571 --> 01:05:47,522
Don't matter,

'cause you ain't
gonna do it.

1132

You're damn right
about that. [laughs]

This is like

You don't want me--
you don't want me

1139
01:06:7,813 --> 01:06:9,481
To jack up all
your pretty curtains.

1140

Oh, son of a bitch.

1141
01:06:12,22 --> 01:06:13,322
I paid it forward

1142
01:06:13,357 --> 01:06:17,110
For a hophead
son of a bitch.

1143
01:06:17,198 --> 01:06:19,149
[coughs] you--you paid--
you paid what?

1144
01:06:19,186 --> 01:06:20,269
I didn't hear that.

1145
01:06:20,355 --> 01:06:22,806
I ain't gonna tell you,

1146
01:06:22,842 --> 01:06:25,210
'cause your ass ain't
good enough to touch it.

1147

[quietly] oh, my ass
ain't good enough, huh?

Chris: Let me
just get this straight.

in her car in las vegas

Tells you about
pay it forward.

1154
01:06:42,347 --> 01:06:43,814
No. She didn't
want to, man,

1155
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:45,100
But, you know,
a brother wouldn't stop

1156
01:06:45,186 --> 01:06:46,186
Until she let it out.

1157
01:06:46,238 --> 01:06:47,488
Well, what I want
to know, sidney,

1158
01:06:47,523 --> 01:06:49,74
What I really want
to know is why?

1159
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,829
Why did you
pay it forward?

1160
01:06:51,865 --> 01:06:53,833
Because
don't nobody tell me

1161
01:06:53,869 --> 01:06:57,38
What I can
and can't touch, yo.

Bonnie: How many times
have I told you

1164
01:07:1,33 --> 01:07:1,883
You're not supposed
to date for a year.

1165
01:07:1,934 --> 01:07:3,534
They're not dates.

1166
01:07:3,588 --> 01:07:4,721
Oh, ok. 7 dinners.
What are they?

1167
01:07:4,807 --> 01:07:6,307
No. It's a couple
of adults

1168
01:07:6,342 --> 01:07:7,309
Sitting down--
and dating.

1169
01:07:7,344 --> 01:07:8,478
No.
Did he pay?

1170
01:07:8,513 --> 01:07:9,647
He pays for everything.

1171
01:07:9,683 --> 01:07:11,567
Trevor, did
anybody ask you?

1172
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:12,986
He's new. He doesn't
know that many people.

1173
01:07:13,23 --> 01:07:13,989
He likes her.

1174
01:07:14,25 --> 01:07:14,991
So?

1175
01:07:15,27 --> 01:07:16,411
He fixed
your tv remote.

1176
01:07:16,496 --> 01:07:18,330
Oh, that's
an engagement ring.

1177
01:07:18,366 --> 01:07:19,917
And he
doesn't drink.

1178
01:07:20,2 --> 01:07:21,920
Do you gotta pee?

1179
01:07:22,6 --> 01:07:23,340
Look.

1180
01:07:25,12 --> 01:07:26,746
I need a smoke.

1181
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:28,99
There. Over there.

1182
01:07:28,185 --> 01:07:29,936
So, has he kissed you?

1183
01:07:30,21 --> 01:07:32,422
No, no, no, no, no.
[laughs]

1184
01:07:32,477 --> 01:07:34,945
Does he want to?

1185
01:07:35,31 --> 01:07:38,284
Sometimes
I think he does.

1186
01:07:38,371 --> 01:07:41,623
He can't really want to,
or he would have.

1187
01:07:41,711 --> 01:07:43,611
Do you want him to?

Whoo!

Shit, bonnie.
It's just taking forever.

1192
01:07:50,411 --> 01:07:52,796
Haven't you ever
gotten to know somebody

1193
01:07:52,883 --> 01:07:54,801
Before you
went to bed with him?

1194
01:08:0,564 --> 01:08:2,298
Is that d?

Um...

1200
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:19,296
Do you want
to come in

1201

And...Stay?

I...

1203
01:08:26,29 --> 01:08:27,997
Come in.

Trevor's
inside the house.

1205
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:34,993
He sleeps
like the dead.

1206

I don't
want to make it

1207
01:08:38,219 --> 01:08:40,170
Any harder for you.

1208
01:08:40,223 --> 01:08:41,206
Well,

1209
01:08:41,259 --> 01:08:42,375
You're supposed
to wait a year.

1210
01:08:42,427 --> 01:08:44,11
Isn't that what
bonnie said to you?

1211
01:08:44,64 --> 01:08:47,350
Ok.

1212
01:08:47,404 --> 01:08:50,22
I...

1213
01:08:51,412 --> 01:08:53,430
I can't.

1214
01:08:55,252 --> 01:08:58,21
Oh.

1215
01:08:58,91 --> 01:09:0,509
I'm sorry.

1216
01:09:0,546 --> 01:09:4,966
No. I don't mean
I can't.

1217
01:09:6,641 --> 01:09:8,759
It's just...

1218
01:09:8,812 --> 01:09:10,730
What?

1219
01:09:13,821 --> 01:09:16,406
It's complicated.

1220
01:09:17,912 --> 01:09:19,780
I get it.

1221
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:23,52
It's ok to say
you don't like me that way.

1222
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:29,364
Is that what
you think it is?

1223
01:09:29,402 --> 01:09:30,735
It's ok.

1224
01:09:30,787 --> 01:09:31,871
Arlene.

1225
01:09:34,829 --> 01:09:37,497
How could you
ever think that?

1226
01:10:13,737 --> 01:10:15,654
What?

1227
01:10:15,707 --> 01:10:17,725
What is it?

[engine starts]

1229
01:10:42,926 --> 01:10:46,45
And you're
doing this because...

1230
01:10:46,99 --> 01:10:47,382
I need more links.

1231
01:10:47,435 --> 01:10:50,153
You're spending $300
to go to vegas

1232
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:51,223
And find an old lady

1233
01:10:51,275 --> 01:10:53,726
So you can sell
a story for $300.

1234
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:54,747
It's a news magazine
feature, rochelle.

1235
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:55,949
All right?

1236
01:10:56,35 --> 01:10:57,452
It's not something
you wipe your ass with.

1237
01:10:57,537 --> 01:10:59,905
You have such a lovely way
of expressing yourself.

1238
01:10:59,959 --> 01:11:1,877
Hey, do me a favor.

1239
01:11:1,929 --> 01:11:3,12
Don't change
the locks on me, ok?

1240
01:11:3,48 --> 01:11:4,131
Hmm.
[kisses]

1241
01:11:4,217 --> 01:11:6,184
Chris, what are you
hoping this'll be?

1242
01:11:6,221 --> 01:11:7,187
Just, you know,

1243
01:11:7,223 --> 01:11:8,189
Something that
clears a check.

1244
01:11:8,225 --> 01:11:9,191
You know?

1245
01:11:9,227 --> 01:11:11,427
Are you sure that's all?

1246
01:11:11,481 --> 01:11:15,67
Look. Ok. I, uh, I drank
the last of the coffee.

1247
01:11:15,122 --> 01:11:16,322
Please put it
on the list.

01:11:46,281 --> 01:11:47,248
â™ª win your love â™ª

1261
01:11:47,283 --> 01:11:48,250
â™ª your love for me â™ª

1262
01:11:48,285 --> 01:11:49,252
Hey.

1263
01:11:49,287 --> 01:11:50,254
Hey.

1264
01:11:50,289 --> 01:11:51,256
Do you
look down on me?

1265
01:11:51,291 --> 01:11:52,258
What?

1266
01:11:52,293 --> 01:11:53,426
Do you
look down on me?

1267
01:11:53,462 --> 01:11:54,428
No.

1268
01:11:54,464 --> 01:11:55,497
'cause I don't
talk like you.

1269
01:11:55,549 --> 01:11:57,100
I haven't read
the stuff you read.

1270
01:11:57,135 --> 01:11:58,218
What are you
talking about?

1271
01:11:58,304 --> 01:11:59,521
That's not pertinent,
and you know it.

1272
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:2,192
Don't talk to me
like that.

1273
01:12:2,279 --> 01:12:5,197
I'm sorry, but that's
the way I talk, you know.

1274
01:12:5,285 --> 01:12:6,702
Words are all I have.

1275
01:12:6,787 --> 01:12:8,204
Why? Why?

1276
01:12:8,291 --> 01:12:9,708
'cause you think
you look like shit?

1277
01:12:9,793 --> 01:12:10,859
Is that it?

1278
01:12:10,912 --> 01:12:13,380
I don't care about
your burns, eugene,

1279
01:12:13,466 --> 01:12:14,383
If that's
even what they are.

1280
01:12:14,468 --> 01:12:16,219
Is that
what they are?

1281
01:12:16,306 --> 01:12:17,306
Yes.

1282
01:12:17,341 --> 01:12:18,891
Ok. Well, whatever
happened to you,

1283
01:12:18,978 --> 01:12:21,563
You look good to me.

1284
01:12:25,824 --> 01:12:27,241
You look good
to me, too.

1285
01:12:27,327 --> 01:12:29,494
Ok. So?

1286
01:12:31,1 --> 01:12:35,254
So I've never
been here before.

1287
01:12:35,343 --> 01:12:37,761
Ok.
So you're scared.

1288
01:12:37,847 --> 01:12:38,764
I'm scared, too.

1289
01:12:38,849 --> 01:12:40,266
Listen.

1290
01:12:40,352 --> 01:12:41,935
Bad things have
happened to me, ok?

1291
01:12:42,22 --> 01:12:43,606
I can't take
my shirt off with a guy

1292
01:12:43,691 --> 01:12:45,392
Without 5 beers in me,

1293
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:47,112
But I want that
with you.

1294
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:50,901
More than I'm scared,
I want that.

1295
01:12:50,989 --> 01:12:53,707
â™ª win your love for me â™ª

1296
01:12:53,745 --> 01:12:54,711
â™ª for me â™ª

1297
01:12:54,747 --> 01:12:55,747
â™ª whoa â™ª

1298
01:12:55,832 --> 01:12:57,299
â™ª whoa â™ª
â™ª whoa â™ª

1299
01:12:57,385 --> 01:12:58,668
[music stops]

1300
01:13:4,97 --> 01:13:5,981
You don't see me.

1301
01:13:7,320 --> 01:13:9,772
All right, my life--

1302
01:13:13,999 --> 01:13:15,750
My life is familiar,

1303
01:13:15,787 --> 01:13:17,671
My life is--

1304
01:13:17,757 --> 01:13:19,291
It's manageable.

1305
01:13:19,343 --> 01:13:20,493
It's manageable.

1306
01:13:20,546 --> 01:13:22,681
Every day...

1307
01:13:22,767 --> 01:13:25,302
I have a thing
I do every day.

1308
01:13:25,355 --> 01:13:27,306
It's all
I've ever known.

1309
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:29,176
And...
It's a routine,

1310
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:30,363
And as long
as I have that--

1311
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:32,700
As long
as I have that--

1312
01:13:32,786 --> 01:13:34,520
I'm ok, I'm ok.

1313
01:13:34,572 --> 01:13:35,789
If I don't have it,
I'm lost.

1314
01:13:35,826 --> 01:13:37,526
So is that
all you want?

1315
01:13:37,578 --> 01:13:39,880
Your god damn
manageable day?

1316
01:13:39,966 --> 01:13:40,966
It's what I have.

1317
01:13:41,1 --> 01:13:43,336
No, it isn't.
Is it what you want?

1318
01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:44,807
Yes!
It's what I want!

1319
01:13:44,843 --> 01:13:46,510
I don't believe you.

1320
01:13:51,338 --> 01:13:53,256
Ok. That's
the best I got.

1321
01:13:53,342 --> 01:13:54,259
It's not about you--

1322
01:13:54,344 --> 01:13:55,377
Yes, it is!

1323
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:57,514
Something's been
offered to you here,

1324
01:13:57,567 --> 01:13:59,218
And you
don't want it.

1325
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:0,987
Maybe you're scared
to get rejected.

1326
01:14:1,24 --> 01:14:2,191
Well, I can't
reject you.

1327
01:14:2,243 --> 01:14:3,660
You're too quick
for me!

1328
01:14:7,169 --> 01:14:8,203
[door slams]

1329
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:29,525
Hey.

1330
01:14:29,562 --> 01:14:31,946
You didn't call me
a fag, did you?

1331
01:14:36,207 --> 01:14:38,409
Hey, look
what I found!

1332
01:14:38,496 --> 01:14:39,562
What do you want?!
Give me that!

1333
01:14:39,615 --> 01:14:40,949
It's
my asthma spray!

1334
01:14:41,34 --> 01:14:41,934
Shut up!

1335
01:14:42,3 --> 01:14:43,553
Adam: Stop it!

1336
01:14:43,605 --> 01:14:44,672
Stay still!

1337
01:14:44,724 --> 01:14:45,674
Stop! Help me!

1338
01:14:45,726 --> 01:14:46,676
Hold still!

1339
01:14:46,728 --> 01:14:48,395
Hey!

1340
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:53,354
Hey, mckinney.

1341
01:14:53,407 --> 01:14:54,357
Come here.

1342
01:14:54,409 --> 01:14:56,527
Boy: Yeah,
let's hang out.

1343
01:14:56,580 --> 01:15:0,232
Help me. Please.

1344
01:15:0,288 --> 01:15:1,888
Screw it.
He's not doing anything.

1345
01:15:1,940 --> 01:15:3,7
Come on.

1346
01:15:3,59 --> 01:15:5,344
Let me go!
Let me go!

1347
01:15:22,781 --> 01:15:24,148
Trevor...

1348
01:15:25,653 --> 01:15:27,537
You cut my class.

1349
01:15:29,494 --> 01:15:31,295
It's been 4 days.

1350
01:15:32,917 --> 01:15:35,385
What's been 4 days?

1351
01:15:35,472 --> 01:15:36,538
Why haven't you
called my mother?

1352
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:38,391
It's been 4 days.

1353
01:15:46,359 --> 01:15:48,110
I don't know.

1354
01:15:50,751 --> 01:15:52,535
Neither does she.

1355
01:16:0,553 --> 01:16:2,304
Hey,
what's the matter?

1356
01:16:7,784 --> 01:16:10,869
Pay it forward
didn't work.

1357
01:16:10,907 --> 01:16:12,874
I couldn't
even do it.

1358
01:16:18,138 --> 01:16:20,88
I was gonna
help adam.

1359
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:27,819
Help adam do what?

1360
01:16:27,906 --> 01:16:29,524
Not get beat up.

1361
01:16:30,744 --> 01:16:33,79
But I crapped out,
and I let him.

1362
01:16:36,923 --> 01:16:38,707
I let him get beat.

1363
01:16:40,129 --> 01:16:42,14
No, you didn't.
You didn't let him get beat.

1364
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:45,135
It just--it--
it happens, you know?

1365
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:47,941
Trevor, sometimes
there's nothing we can do.

1366
01:16:49,615 --> 01:16:50,948
It's not fair.

1367
01:16:50,984 --> 01:16:52,985
I know--
no!

1368
01:16:53,38 --> 01:16:55,122
You don't know.

1369
01:16:56,461 --> 01:16:58,161
You should call
my mother.

1370
01:16:58,215 --> 01:16:59,197
You could do
something

1371
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:1,334
If you wanted.

1372
01:17:1,387 --> 01:17:3,405
Why are you
so chicken?

1373
01:17:3,491 --> 01:17:4,692
Trevor, I'm not chicken--

1374
01:17:4,777 --> 01:17:5,694
Something's
gonna happen.

1375
01:17:5,779 --> 01:17:7,530
Then it'll
be too late.

1376
01:17:11,39 --> 01:17:13,157
What's gonna happen?
What do you mean?

1377
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,881
He'll come back.

1378
01:17:18,888 --> 01:17:21,205
Who will come back?

1379
01:17:21,259 --> 01:17:23,9
Hey, who will come--

1380
01:17:29,7 --> 01:17:30,824
Your dad.

1381
01:17:35,837 --> 01:17:37,838
Your dad will come back?

1382
01:17:40,429 --> 01:17:42,213
And...

1383
01:17:44,303 --> 01:17:45,303
What will happen

1384
01:17:45,388 --> 01:17:47,689
When he comes back,
trevor?

1385
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:53,117
Will he hurt you?

1386
01:17:59,81 --> 01:18:0,915
Will he hurt her?

1387
01:18:7,681 --> 01:18:9,849
Not if
someone's there...

1388
01:18:11,606 --> 01:18:13,490
Instead of him.

1389
01:18:16,682 --> 01:18:18,432
[whispering] trevor...

1390
01:18:22,326 --> 01:18:24,161
Trevor, it's--

1391
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:27,231
It's complicated
for me now. I...

1392
01:18:31,43 --> 01:18:33,461
Is the world
just shit?

1393
01:18:36,854 --> 01:18:38,722
No, it isn't.

1394
01:18:40,394 --> 01:18:42,545
Hey.

1395
01:18:42,631 --> 01:18:44,499
You did good work.

1396
01:18:44,552 --> 01:18:47,220
Look at me.
I'm proud of you, trevor.

1397
01:18:47,308 --> 01:18:49,275
I'm proud of you.

1398
01:18:52,902 --> 01:18:55,987
And anyway,
for what it's worth,

1399
01:18:56,41 --> 01:18:57,191
I'm grading you
on the effort,

1400
01:18:57,243 --> 01:18:58,994
Not the result.

1401
01:19:3,672 --> 01:19:6,7
I don't care
about the grade.

1402
01:19:20,204 --> 01:19:21,371
I just wanted to see

1403
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:23,624
If the world
would really change.

1404
01:19:51,764 --> 01:19:53,765
[knock on door]

1405
01:20:1,583 --> 01:20:3,651
Hi.

1406
01:20:3,704 --> 01:20:5,788
Hi.

1407
01:20:7,779 --> 01:20:9,796
Uh, come in.

1408
01:22:8,361 --> 01:22:10,446
Ohh! Trevor!

1409
01:22:10,482 --> 01:22:11,482
It worked!

1410
01:22:11,534 --> 01:22:13,268
Oh, god!

1411
01:22:15,307 --> 01:22:17,108
Eugene: Does he always
get up this early?

1412
01:22:17,145 --> 01:22:18,145
What?

1413
01:22:18,197 --> 01:22:19,513
Oh, my god,
this is not good.

1414
01:22:19,566 --> 01:22:20,515
He just saw me!

1415
01:22:20,568 --> 01:22:22,68
It's ok!

1416
01:22:22,154 --> 01:22:23,954
Now you have to
pay it forward, too!

1417
01:22:23,991 --> 01:22:25,358
Trevor: Eugene?

1418
01:22:25,443 --> 01:22:26,393
I think you should

1419
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:28,513
Still call me
mr. Simonet.

1420
01:22:28,566 --> 01:22:29,516
You had a sleepover,
didn't you?

1421
01:22:29,568 --> 01:22:30,518
Why don't you
go back to bed?

1422
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:31,537
Why?

1423
01:22:31,622 --> 01:22:32,688
It's too early
for you to be up--

1424
01:22:32,741 --> 01:22:33,991
No, it's not early!
No, it's a Sunday!

1425
01:22:34,43 --> 01:22:34,993
It's a Sunday?

1426
01:22:35,45 --> 01:22:36,212
Yeah.

1427
01:22:36,297 --> 01:22:37,331
So stay, stay!

1428
01:22:37,383 --> 01:22:38,333
You don't
understand,

1429
01:22:38,385 --> 01:22:39,335
I have
a whole schedule

1430
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:40,470
That you don't
know about.

1431
01:22:40,506 --> 01:22:42,39
All right, well,
bring everything here!

1432
01:22:42,92 --> 01:22:43,510
Would you please
take care of him?

1433
01:22:43,562 --> 01:22:45,212
I'll call you later,
all right?

1434
01:22:45,265 --> 01:22:46,232
Don't be a stranger!

1435
01:22:46,317 --> 01:22:47,351
God, trevor!

1436
01:22:47,403 --> 01:22:48,686
Trevor: Do you like him?

1437
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:26,743
Ok.

1438
01:24:2,296 --> 01:24:5,215
[woman sobbing]

1439
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:13,331
Hey! Hey, hey!

1440
01:24:13,384 --> 01:24:14,835
Lady, come on.

1441
01:24:14,921 --> 01:24:16,321
Go away.

1442
01:24:16,374 --> 01:24:18,975
I-I'm not
gonna hurt you, lady.

1443
01:24:19,28 --> 01:24:20,395
Oh, here, take it!

1444
01:24:20,432 --> 01:24:21,432
Well, it's
a nice thought,

1445
01:24:21,484 --> 01:24:22,817
But it's not
what I want.

1446
01:24:22,903 --> 01:24:24,854
What--what--

1447
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:26,474
Hey, what
are you doing?

1448
01:24:26,526 --> 01:24:28,977
I'm not
gonna hurt you!

1449
01:24:29,31 --> 01:24:31,283
What are you--hey!

1450
01:24:31,336 --> 01:24:34,338
Oh, my god!
Listen to me.

1451
01:24:34,425 --> 01:24:35,375
Nothing's
this important!

1452
01:24:35,461 --> 01:24:37,678
Come on, come--
come down here!

1453
01:24:37,765 --> 01:24:39,165
What are you doing?

1454
01:24:39,217 --> 01:24:41,502
Woman: What do
you care, anyway?

1455
01:24:41,588 --> 01:24:42,889
Because I owe
somebody a favor.

1456
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:44,876
Not me.

1457
01:24:44,961 --> 01:24:46,462
Why not you?

1458
01:24:46,515 --> 01:24:47,882
You know--heh!

1459
01:24:47,967 --> 01:24:49,435
A minute ago,

1460
01:24:49,471 --> 01:24:50,888
All I could
think about

1461
01:24:50,973 --> 01:24:53,542
Was getting
my next fix,

1462
01:24:53,628 --> 01:24:56,680
And then I saw you,
a-and...

1463
01:24:56,768 --> 01:24:58,135
I changed
my thinking.

1464
01:24:58,188 --> 01:24:59,471
Oh, please!

1465
01:24:59,523 --> 01:25:0,807
Go away!

1466
01:25:0,859 --> 01:25:2,893
Trust me,
I'm not worth it.

1467
01:25:2,980 --> 01:25:4,981
Why's that?

1468
01:25:5,34 --> 01:25:6,284
Oh, for god's sake!

1469
01:25:6,319 --> 01:25:7,319
Come on, tell me!

1470
01:25:7,371 --> 01:25:9,823
Why are you
not worth it?

1471
01:25:9,876 --> 01:25:12,294
Trust me...

1472
01:25:12,331 --> 01:25:14,532
You wouldn't understand.

1473
01:25:14,586 --> 01:25:16,420
Are you kidding me?

1474
01:25:16,506 --> 01:25:18,591
You think
I live at the ritz?

1475
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:25,102
Have a cup of coffee
with me?

1476
01:25:26,642 --> 01:25:28,476
What?

1477
01:25:35,692 --> 01:25:38,60
Do me a favor.

1478
01:25:39,817 --> 01:25:41,785
Save my life.

1479
01:25:48,634 --> 01:25:50,151
[shouting]

1480
01:25:50,204 --> 01:25:51,154
Get him! Get him!

1481
01:25:51,206 --> 01:25:52,489
Off the ropes!
Off the ropes!

1482
01:25:52,542 --> 01:25:54,109
Oh, he missed him.

1483
01:25:54,161 --> 01:25:56,579
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, he did!

1484
01:25:56,617 --> 01:25:57,967
Bam-ba-bam-ba-bam-ba-bam!

1485
01:25:58,19 --> 01:26:0,754
Oh, oh, come on,
bleed, dude.

1486
01:26:0,808 --> 01:26:1,958
Announcer: Distraction
from the imperial...

1487
01:26:2,10 --> 01:26:3,127
Oh, he's got him.
Give the ddt!

1488
01:26:3,179 --> 01:26:4,763
What?

1489
01:26:4,815 --> 01:26:5,899
It's gonna
be a ddt.

1490
01:26:5,934 --> 01:26:7,351
Up he goes,
and drop him on his head!

1491
01:26:8,756 --> 01:26:11,558
Oh, he's dead.
He's dead.

1492
01:26:11,596 --> 01:26:13,112
Ok, fearless,
get out of the ring.

1493
01:26:13,148 --> 01:26:14,115
What do you mean,
get out of the ring?

1494
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,200
You can't get
out of t ring.

1495
01:26:15,235 --> 01:26:16,435
Yes, he can.
He has to get a chair.

1496
01:26:16,488 --> 01:26:17,771
A chair?

1497
01:26:17,823 --> 01:26:19,440
[whispering]

1498
01:26:19,494 --> 01:26:20,544
Bam!

1499
01:26:20,579 --> 01:26:22,230
Aah!

1500
01:26:22,282 --> 01:26:23,282
Slow motion.

1501
01:26:26,708 --> 01:26:28,42
Hyah!

1502
01:26:28,94 --> 01:26:30,728
Trevor, when did you
become so violent?

1503
01:26:30,782 --> 01:26:33,150
Oh, no, no, no.
Take me to a match.

1504
01:26:33,186 --> 01:26:34,570
You get splattered
in the front row.

1505
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:35,990
I don't want to be
splattered, thank you--

1506
01:26:36,25 --> 01:26:38,76
Yes, you do.
It'll be, like,

1507
01:26:38,163 --> 01:26:39,496
Your birthday
present to me.

1508
01:26:39,532 --> 01:26:40,699
Oh, no. You know what you're
getting for your birthday?

1509
01:26:40,751 --> 01:26:41,701
What?

1510
01:26:41,753 --> 01:26:43,69
A brand-new encyclopedia...

1511
01:26:43,123 --> 01:26:44,256
Oh, ohh.

1512
01:26:44,342 --> 01:26:45,659
Leather-bound...

1513
01:26:45,694 --> 01:26:48,729
Thucydides' history
of the peloponnesian war.

1514
01:26:48,783 --> 01:26:51,335
No, I'm getting you
51 crackling volumes.

1515
01:26:51,371 --> 01:26:54,256
There'll be
pop quizzes every day

1516
01:26:54,344 --> 01:26:56,345
On the development
of cotton farms--

1517
01:26:56,381 --> 01:26:57,348
Hi, arlene.

1518
01:26:57,383 --> 01:26:58,850
Unh!

1519
01:27:43,889 --> 01:27:46,274
You can't
stay here, ricky.

1520
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:48,245
I know.

1521
01:27:48,298 --> 01:27:49,915
Look, I know
what we had

1522
01:27:49,967 --> 01:27:51,718
Was a nightmare,
arlene,

1523
01:27:51,754 --> 01:27:53,955
But I did it.

1524
01:27:54,8 --> 01:27:55,292
You did what?

1525
01:27:55,344 --> 01:27:56,978
I knew I
couldn't come back

1526
01:27:57,64 --> 01:27:59,933
To this house
unless I was sober.

1527
01:28:1,356 --> 01:28:3,640
It's the truth.

1528
01:28:3,694 --> 01:28:6,863
5 months,
2 weeks, and 4 days

1529
01:28:6,950 --> 01:28:8,367
Of the truth.

1530
01:28:8,453 --> 01:28:9,754
[clears throat]

1531
01:28:9,789 --> 01:28:10,873
Where you been?

1532
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:12,342
What does it
matter?

1533
01:28:12,427 --> 01:28:14,345
I knew
I had to change.

1534
01:28:14,431 --> 01:28:16,382
Are you sober?

1535
01:28:16,468 --> 01:28:19,837
Yeah, and I got sober
staying right here.

1536
01:28:19,892 --> 01:28:21,675
Well, you're
stronger than me.

1537
01:28:21,729 --> 01:28:23,863
Can you just stop
for a minute...

1538
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:25,784
Please?

1539
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:28,488
Can we just
sit down and talk?

1540
01:28:30,495 --> 01:28:31,495
Ok.

1541
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:40,847
[sighs]

1542
01:28:45,775 --> 01:28:46,775
[sighs]

1543
01:28:49,549 --> 01:28:50,532
[sighs]

1544
01:29:47,10 --> 01:29:47,959
Hi.

1545
01:29:48,12 --> 01:29:48,961
God!

1546
01:29:49,14 --> 01:29:50,798
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1547
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:52,183
What are you
doing here?

1548
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:53,570
I want you
to understand--

1549
01:29:53,605 --> 01:29:54,906
Oh, it's not
necessary, really.

1550
01:29:54,941 --> 01:29:56,108
No explanation
required.

1551
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,528
Please don't talk
to me like that.

1552
01:29:58,614 --> 01:30:1,583
We had 13 years in,
eugene.

1553
01:30:1,620 --> 01:30:2,704
He's sober now.

1554
01:30:2,789 --> 01:30:4,123
We've never been
sober together.

1555
01:30:4,176 --> 01:30:5,259
Well,
I wish you luck.

1556
01:30:5,295 --> 01:30:8,380
I feel like I gotta
give him a chance.

1557
01:30:8,468 --> 01:30:9,885
A chance?

1558
01:30:9,970 --> 01:30:11,20
A chance
for what?

1559
01:30:11,106 --> 01:30:13,357
To change,

1560
01:30:13,443 --> 01:30:15,844
To try to make up
for lost time.

1561
01:30:15,898 --> 01:30:18,182
Oh, what, to take trevor
to some ball games?

1562
01:30:18,236 --> 01:30:19,703
Do some real daddy
things with him?

1563
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:20,705
Yeah.

1564
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:22,458
He promised
to try.

1565
01:30:22,495 --> 01:30:23,461
What do you
want me to do?

1566
01:30:23,496 --> 01:30:24,862
Oh, I don't know,
be smart.

1567
01:30:24,899 --> 01:30:25,982
He's his father,
eugene.

1568
01:30:26,34 --> 01:30:27,702
He impregnated you,
arlene.

1569
01:30:27,787 --> 01:30:30,322
In what other way has he
been a father to trevor?

1570
01:30:30,376 --> 01:30:33,462
Unless knocking somebody
around is a new family value.

1571
01:30:33,499 --> 01:30:34,749
What are you
talking about?

1572
01:30:34,835 --> 01:30:36,135
He never
touched trevor.

1573
01:30:36,170 --> 01:30:38,37
Oh, that's right.

1574
01:30:38,91 --> 01:30:39,775
Only you.

1575
01:30:39,845 --> 01:30:41,545
He only took it
out on you.

1576
01:30:41,614 --> 01:30:43,231
That's so much better.

1577
01:30:46,491 --> 01:30:48,224
What did trevor
tell you?

1578
01:30:48,277 --> 01:30:50,27
Enough.

1579
01:30:50,80 --> 01:30:52,665
Christ, arlene. Secrets
like that shouldn't be kept.

1580
01:30:52,702 --> 01:30:54,202
What good
does it do trevor?

1581
01:30:54,255 --> 01:30:56,373
You weren't there.
Ricky never meant to hit me.

1582
01:30:56,426 --> 01:30:57,510
We were drunk--

1583
01:30:57,545 --> 01:30:59,946
Christ! What is it
with women like you?

1584
01:31:0,33 --> 01:31:1,283
Is that something you
really tell yourself?

1585
01:31:1,368 --> 01:31:4,37
"oh, it's ok he beat me.
Trevor's ok"?

1586
01:31:4,91 --> 01:31:6,375
Trevor has locked
himself in a bathroom,

1587
01:31:6,428 --> 01:31:7,846
And he can't breathe,

1588
01:31:7,882 --> 01:31:9,599
And he's--and he's
hoping and praying

1589
01:31:9,685 --> 01:31:10,601
That it will stop.

1590
01:31:10,687 --> 01:31:11,770
Trevor never
went through--

1591
01:31:11,856 --> 01:31:13,806
How do you know what
trevor went through?

1592
01:31:13,893 --> 01:31:15,694
How do you know?

1593
01:31:15,730 --> 01:31:17,764
How do you know that
next time after you,

1594
01:31:17,817 --> 01:31:19,652
He doesn't
come for trevor?

1595
01:31:19,737 --> 01:31:22,155
I know what I'm
talking about, arlene.

1596
01:31:22,243 --> 01:31:24,827
My father
got on his knees

1597
01:31:24,914 --> 01:31:26,298
And begged
my mother,

1598
01:31:26,384 --> 01:31:27,450
And my mother,

1599
01:31:27,503 --> 01:31:29,387
She always
took him back.

1600
01:31:29,422 --> 01:31:31,140
I never understood it.

1601
01:31:31,226 --> 01:31:32,843
She covered the bruises
and the cuts,

1602
01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:34,898
And she'd take him back

1603
01:31:34,934 --> 01:31:37,52
Because he begged

1604
01:31:37,88 --> 01:31:38,922
And he cried.

1605
01:31:38,974 --> 01:31:40,625
And now you ask me
what happened

1606
01:31:40,678 --> 01:31:41,628
After he came back.

1607
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:42,613
No--
no, go on!

1608
01:31:42,665 --> 01:31:43,749
You said
you wanted to know

1609
01:31:43,801 --> 01:31:44,734
What happened to me.
Now ask me.

1610
01:31:44,786 --> 01:31:45,936
I don't like this.

1611
01:31:45,988 --> 01:31:48,123
Did he hurt you,
eugene? Ask me!

1612
01:31:49,628 --> 01:31:50,745
Did he hurt you?

1613
01:31:51,799 --> 01:31:53,300
Not for long.

1614
01:31:53,386 --> 01:31:56,505
By 13, I was gone.
I ran away...

1615
01:31:56,592 --> 01:31:58,459
But I missed her,

1616
01:31:58,512 --> 01:32:0,680
So I had to go back
and see her.

1617
01:32:0,766 --> 01:32:3,634
And so one night, I did.

1618
01:32:3,689 --> 01:32:5,273
Now ask me what
happened that night.

1619
01:32:5,326 --> 01:32:7,476
What happened that night
you came back, eugene?

1620
01:32:7,530 --> 01:32:8,863
What happened?

1621
01:32:8,949 --> 01:32:10,316
He was there...

1622
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:12,169
Drunk as usual.

1623
01:32:12,255 --> 01:32:14,290
Only this time,
I wasn't the same.

1624
01:32:14,343 --> 01:32:16,93
I was 16 years old,

1625
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:18,548
And I was no longer
afraid of him.

1626
01:32:18,634 --> 01:32:20,218
And when I looked
him in the eye

1627
01:32:20,304 --> 01:32:22,355
And told him if he
ever touched her again

1628
01:32:22,441 --> 01:32:23,358
I would kill him,

1629
01:32:23,443 --> 01:32:25,311
He knew...

1630
01:32:25,364 --> 01:32:27,281
He knew that
he would never exist

1631
01:32:27,318 --> 01:32:29,518
For me again.

1632
01:32:29,572 --> 01:32:31,806
And I'm standing
in front of the house.

1633
01:32:31,859 --> 01:32:33,360
I'm telling her,

1634
01:32:33,446 --> 01:32:34,647
I'm screaming
for her to come out.

1635
01:32:34,699 --> 01:32:36,182
I'm telling her
she doesn't have to--

1636
01:32:36,234 --> 01:32:37,551
She doesn't have
to take it anymore.

1637
01:32:37,638 --> 01:32:38,554
She really doesn't.

1638
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:39,605
She can come
with me now.

1639
01:32:39,641 --> 01:32:40,974
I don't even
see it coming.

1640
01:32:41,28 --> 01:32:42,61
He hits me in
the side of the head

1641
01:32:42,146 --> 01:32:43,63
With a 2x4,

1642
01:32:43,148 --> 01:32:44,348
And I'm bleeding
from my ear.

1643
01:32:44,401 --> 01:32:45,984
And then
he's dragging me.

1644
01:32:46,37 --> 01:32:47,153
He's dragging me
behind the house

1645
01:32:47,205 --> 01:32:48,522
And into the garage,
and then he's gone.

1646
01:32:48,575 --> 01:32:50,710
A minute, 5 minutes,
I don't know.

1647
01:32:50,796 --> 01:32:52,530
And then he's back, and
he's wetting me down.

1648
01:32:52,582 --> 01:32:55,0
He's wetting me down,
and I don't understand.

1649
01:32:55,55 --> 01:32:57,639
I don't understand
why water...

1650
01:32:57,676 --> 01:33:0,478
Should smell so bad.

1651
01:33:0,515 --> 01:33:2,232
I don't understand.

1652
01:33:2,318 --> 01:33:5,186
And then I see it.

1653
01:33:5,240 --> 01:33:7,24
I see...

1654
01:33:9,499 --> 01:33:10,499
This...

1655
01:33:14,7 --> 01:33:15,758
This gas can,

1656
01:33:15,844 --> 01:33:21,132
This red gas can
from his trunk.

1657
01:33:26,63 --> 01:33:29,65
And he looks at me
one last time...

1658
01:33:31,73 --> 01:33:32,824
And he lights a match.

1659
01:33:36,717 --> 01:33:39,586
And the last thing
I remember...

1660
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:42,124
And I'll never
forget it...

1661
01:33:42,178 --> 01:33:43,979
Were his eyes.

1662
01:33:45,769 --> 01:33:49,738
His eyes because they
were filled with this...

1663
01:33:49,776 --> 01:33:53,245
Immense...

1664
01:33:53,282 --> 01:33:56,451
Satisfaction.

1665
01:33:59,294 --> 01:34:0,661
I'm so sorry--

1666
01:34:0,713 --> 01:34:4,482
Don't--don't--don't tell me
how sorry you are for me!

1667
01:34:4,538 --> 01:34:6,489
Just tell me how
you're gonna stop it

1668
01:34:6,575 --> 01:34:7,575
Happening to trevor.

1669
01:34:7,611 --> 01:34:9,995
Ricky would
never do that.

1670
01:34:10,82 --> 01:34:13,584
Oh, jesus, arlene.
He doesn't have to.

1671
01:34:15,676 --> 01:34:17,844
All he has to do
is not love him.

1672
01:34:31,924 --> 01:34:32,924
[door closes]

1673
01:35:15,507 --> 01:35:16,657
[honking horn]

1674
01:35:18,113 --> 01:35:19,113
Jesus!

1675
01:35:23,323 --> 01:35:26,141
[radio playing
papa roach's last resort]

1676
01:35:26,228 --> 01:35:28,896
â™ª this is my last resort â™ª

1677
01:35:30,286 --> 01:35:31,369
Hey.

1678
01:35:34,210 --> 01:35:35,377
â™ª cut my life
into pieces-- â™ª

1679
01:35:35,463 --> 01:35:36,713
What's going on?

1680
01:35:36,798 --> 01:35:39,417
What's going on?
What's going on?

1681
01:35:39,504 --> 01:35:40,637
What are you doing?

1682
01:35:40,673 --> 01:35:41,890
What's it look
like I'm doing?

1683
01:35:41,975 --> 01:35:44,10
What are you putting
in my room?

1684
01:35:44,63 --> 01:35:46,597
We had an agreement.

1685
01:35:46,684 --> 01:35:48,902
My son won't
talk to me.

1686
01:35:48,988 --> 01:35:50,555
He won't even
look at me!

1687
01:35:50,608 --> 01:35:51,558
What the hell
did you do

1688
01:35:51,610 --> 01:35:52,560
To turn him
against me?

1689
01:35:52,612 --> 01:35:53,863
I didn't do anything.

1690
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:55,65
I told you I wasn't gonna
make him talk to you.

1691
01:35:55,117 --> 01:35:57,168
You could go
get a job.

1692
01:35:57,204 --> 01:35:58,571
What am I supposed
to use for a car?

1693
01:35:58,623 --> 01:36:0,91
The bus.
That's what I do.

1694
01:36:0,177 --> 01:36:1,577
Yeah, that'll
be the day.

1695
01:36:1,629 --> 01:36:3,630
Ricky, you can't
stay in this room.

1696
01:36:3,717 --> 01:36:4,850
Look, this is
our room, baby.

1697
01:36:4,886 --> 01:36:6,853
Ok, this is our house.
This is our bed--

1698
01:36:6,890 --> 01:36:7,856
You've been drinking.

1699
01:36:7,892 --> 01:36:8,858
Kiss me.
Stop it.

1700
01:36:8,894 --> 01:36:11,295
Stop it. Stop it.

1701
01:36:11,381 --> 01:36:13,382
â™ª I never realized
I was spread too thin â™ª

1702
01:36:13,469 --> 01:36:14,552
[louder]
â™ª till it was too late â™ª

1703
01:36:14,604 --> 01:36:16,122
â™ª and I was empty within-- â™ª

1704
01:36:16,208 --> 01:36:18,426
I want you out.

Turn that noise down!

1708
01:36:22,771 --> 01:36:24,304
I'm gonna come in there
and pound your ass, boy!

1709
01:36:24,390 --> 01:36:26,374
Don't talk to him
like that.

1710
01:36:26,427 --> 01:36:28,678
[music stops]

1711
01:36:28,715 --> 01:36:30,883
I've had enough of
this shit around here.

1712
01:36:30,936 --> 01:36:31,886
Yeah, what are you
gonna do?

1713
01:36:31,938 --> 01:36:33,755
Get out!

1714
01:36:33,808 --> 01:36:35,392
You know, I like you
a whole lot better

1715
01:36:35,444 --> 01:36:36,895
When you had
a few drinks in you.

[pounds on door]

1717
01:36:38,367 --> 01:36:40,902
You want me out
of the house? I'm out.

1718
01:36:40,972 --> 01:36:42,573
Sorry.

1719
01:36:47,585 --> 01:36:50,137
I think
I made a mistake.

1720
01:36:55,817 --> 01:36:58,252
Everybody
makes mistakes.

1721
01:37:0,242 --> 01:37:2,76

01:37:50,205 --> 01:37:52,540
I was wonderin' if
you could help me out.

[school bell rings]

1732
01:37:59,56 --> 01:38:0,539
All right,
bring them up.

1733
01:38:0,591 --> 01:38:2,476
Thank you.
Carefully.

1734
01:38:5,17 --> 01:38:7,685
Thank you. Careful. Did you
get rid of your hiccups?

1735
01:38:7,739 --> 01:38:8,889
Girl: Yes.
Good.

1736
01:38:8,941 --> 01:38:10,575
I told you holding
your breath would work.

1737
01:38:10,661 --> 01:38:11,577
Thank you.

1738
01:38:11,663 --> 01:38:14,364
Careful. Thank you.

1739
01:38:14,418 --> 01:38:18,371
Thanks.
That's very nice.

1740
01:38:18,426 --> 01:38:20,10
Give me that one.

1741
01:38:20,46 --> 01:38:23,748
Thank you.
Thank you.

1742
01:38:23,803 --> 01:38:25,954
Thank you.
Thank you.

1743
01:38:34,741 --> 01:38:36,342
Trevor, what is it?

1744
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:40,46
Are you still gonna
pay it forward?

1745
01:38:44,410 --> 01:38:48,212
You could say
you don't have to.

1746
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:50,784
'cause it
didn't work out.

1747
01:38:50,839 --> 01:38:53,590
But I thought
you still might.

1748
01:39:0,239 --> 01:39:2,958
Trevor, I would like
more than anything

1749
01:39:3,45 --> 01:39:4,913
To do that for you.

1750
01:39:4,966 --> 01:39:7,584
And when I find
something worthy of--

1751
01:39:7,637 --> 01:39:9,638
I know somebody
who needs something.

1752
01:39:9,724 --> 01:39:12,143
Trevor, you have to let
me find this on my own.

1753
01:39:12,229 --> 01:39:14,297
You know who it is.

1754
01:39:16,755 --> 01:39:18,473
Look...

1755
01:39:18,558 --> 01:39:22,478
You don't understand
everything, all right?

1756
01:39:22,566 --> 01:39:25,318
So you do not know
what you're asking.

1757
01:39:25,405 --> 01:39:28,190
Give her
another chance.

1758
01:39:31,32 --> 01:39:35,35
I will pay it forward,
I promise you that...

1759
01:39:35,107 --> 01:39:37,575
But I cannot do that.

1760
01:39:50,987 --> 01:39:53,872
But that's why
this is the one...

1761
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:56,678
Because it's
supposed to be

1762
01:39:56,749 --> 01:39:58,249
Something hard.

1763
01:40:1,524 --> 01:40:2,591
If you hp my mom,

1764
01:40:2,676 --> 01:40:4,210
Even if you're
still mad at her,

1765
01:40:4,263 --> 01:40:5,213
If you helped her
in a way

1766
01:40:5,264 --> 01:40:6,348
Nobody else could--

1767
01:40:6,400 --> 01:40:7,517
Did she ask you
to come talk to me--

1768
01:40:7,570 --> 01:40:8,970
No. She thinks you'll
never forgive her,

1769
01:40:9,5 --> 01:40:10,890
But I still think
you could.

1770
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:16,65
If you wanted to do
something really huge...

1771
01:40:19,576 --> 01:40:21,694
For someone...

1772
01:40:23,249 --> 01:40:24,733
For my project...

1773
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:31,461
For me.

1774
01:40:37,276 --> 01:40:38,643
Trevor,
she made her choice.

1775
01:40:38,729 --> 01:40:40,429
She said
she made a mistake.

1776
01:40:40,482 --> 01:40:42,817
Well, that's
the beauty of hindsight.

1777
01:41:0,470 --> 01:41:2,54
You don't care.

1778
01:41:4,478 --> 01:41:6,746
Yes, I do.

1779
01:41:6,816 --> 01:41:9,318
I will always care.

1780
01:41:9,405 --> 01:41:11,606
About you, always.

1781
01:41:14,732 --> 01:41:16,249
Yeah.

1782
01:41:17,754 --> 01:41:19,588
You're my teacher.

1783
01:41:19,641 --> 01:41:22,176
They pay you to.

1784
01:42:10,5 --> 01:42:11,88
You got it?

1785
01:42:11,174 --> 01:42:12,224
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.

1786
01:42:16,517 --> 01:42:19,102
I ain't saying a thing
till I get one more.

1787
01:42:19,189 --> 01:42:21,824
You know...

1788
01:42:21,861 --> 01:42:24,246
I thought you might
feel that way.

1789
01:42:27,421 --> 01:42:30,40
Uh-uh, no, no. Later.

1790
01:42:38,944 --> 01:42:40,978
I got my places,

1791
01:42:41,65 --> 01:42:43,366
Places...

1792
01:42:43,402 --> 01:42:46,204
Where nobody cares where
you park overnight.

1793
01:42:49,46 --> 01:42:52,465
Places where I live.

1794
01:42:52,553 --> 01:42:57,740
Anybody who knows me
knows where to find me.

1795
01:43:10,588 --> 01:43:12,255
Hi, mom.

1796
01:43:14,228 --> 01:43:15,478
What are you doing here?

1797
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:17,181
I wanted to see you.

1798
01:43:19,772 --> 01:43:21,72
After 3 years--

1799
01:43:21,108 --> 01:43:24,277
I couldn't--I can't
watch you do this.

1800
01:43:28,372 --> 01:43:29,622
I drive by
your house.

1801
01:43:29,674 --> 01:43:31,208
I know.

1802
01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:33,930
He's big.

1803
01:43:33,966 --> 01:43:34,966
Yeah.

1804
01:43:37,940 --> 01:43:39,724
What are you doing here?

1805
01:43:39,811 --> 01:43:41,778
Are--are you...

1806
01:43:41,815 --> 01:43:44,400
Are you gonna try
to put me somewhere?

1807
01:43:44,486 --> 01:43:46,320
No.

1808
01:43:46,373 --> 01:43:49,42
Then what do you want?

1809
01:43:49,128 --> 01:43:52,998
I want to try
to do something.

1810
01:43:57,344 --> 01:44:0,413
All the things...

1811
01:44:0,484 --> 01:44:2,184
When I was a kid...

1812
01:44:4,157 --> 01:44:7,609
The booze...

1813
01:44:7,681 --> 01:44:9,332
And the men.

1814
01:44:11,338 --> 01:44:12,254
What happened to me

1815
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:14,424
When you
weren't looking.

1816
01:44:18,469 --> 01:44:20,853
I know
we're all weak.

1817
01:44:20,890 --> 01:44:22,256
Oh, not you--

1818
01:44:22,309 --> 01:44:24,894
No, I've been weak.

1819
01:44:26,734 --> 01:44:28,485
Well...

1820
01:44:28,571 --> 01:44:30,405
Here's the thing.

1821
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:36,634
I forgive you.

1822
01:44:54,287 --> 01:44:56,122
Oh...

1823
01:45:12,38 --> 01:45:13,572
I don't like
your hair--

1824
01:45:13,658 --> 01:45:16,210
I know. I'm not
putting it back.

1825
01:45:20,638 --> 01:45:23,206
So, I'd like to
see you sometimes.

1826
01:45:23,259 --> 01:45:24,759
Is that ok?

1827
01:45:27,484 --> 01:45:28,851
Yes.

1828
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:31,740
You can't
live with me?

1829
01:45:31,826 --> 01:45:32,826
No.

1830
01:45:34,865 --> 01:45:36,282
I wouldn't want to.

1831
01:45:36,368 --> 01:45:37,368
Ha ha.

1832
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:41,909
Can I see him?

1833
01:45:41,979 --> 01:45:44,13
Not drunk.

1834
01:45:44,50 --> 01:45:45,16
You gotta be sober,

1835
01:45:45,52 --> 01:45:46,469
Even if it's
just for 2 hours.

1836
01:45:46,554 --> 01:45:48,222
Yeah, I can do that.

1837
01:45:48,275 --> 01:45:49,275
Ok.

1838
01:45:54,69 --> 01:45:55,653
Well, then I'll
come and find you.

1839
01:45:55,739 --> 01:45:56,739
Ok?

1840
01:45:58,127 --> 01:46:0,128
Yeah.

1841
01:46:0,214 --> 01:46:2,165
Ok.

1842
01:46:2,252 --> 01:46:4,419
Why'd you
do this, arley?

1843
01:46:8,596 --> 01:46:13,800
So, she told me why.

1844
01:46:13,856 --> 01:46:18,944
She told me I had
to do something big...

1845
01:46:19,0 --> 01:46:21,1
For 3 other people.

1846
01:46:21,87 --> 01:46:24,373
â™ª happy birthday,
dear trevor â™ª

1847
01:46:24,460 --> 01:46:28,680
â™ª happy birthday to you â™ª

1848
01:46:28,769 --> 01:46:32,221
â™ª and many more â™ª

1849
01:46:32,309 --> 01:46:34,226
[cheering and applause]

1850
01:46:41,977 --> 01:46:43,811
[cheering and applause]

1851
01:46:43,864 --> 01:46:46,149
What'd you wish for?
What'd you wish for?

1852
01:46:46,202 --> 01:46:47,436
He can't tell you
what he wished for,

1853
01:46:47,471 --> 01:46:48,471
Or it won't come true.

1854
01:46:48,523 --> 01:46:51,174
Can I have some napkins?

1855
01:46:51,229 --> 01:46:53,179
Who wants a big--
where's my knife?

1856
01:46:53,233 --> 01:46:54,383
[knock on door]

1857
01:46:56,272 --> 01:46:57,556
I'll get it.

1858
01:47:4,187 --> 01:47:5,187
Mom?

1859
01:47:7,276 --> 01:47:8,343
Hello.

1860
01:47:8,395 --> 01:47:9,512
Hi. Mrs. Mckinney,
I'm chris chandler.

1861
01:47:9,564 --> 01:47:10,647
I'm a reporter.
I was wondering

1862
01:47:10,700 --> 01:47:11,783
If I could have
a moment of your time.

1863
01:47:11,818 --> 01:47:13,269
Why?

1864
01:47:13,304 --> 01:47:15,4
I don't have anything
to say about anything.

1865
01:47:15,58 --> 01:47:17,393
Please, I've already
spoken to your mother,

1866
01:47:17,479 --> 01:47:19,280
Which naturally
led me to you, so...

1867
01:47:19,316 --> 01:47:20,266
My mother?

1868
01:47:20,301 --> 01:47:21,268
She told me about

1869
01:47:21,303 --> 01:47:22,420
The pay it forward
idea

1870
01:47:22,456 --> 01:47:23,456
And how you've
helped her out,

1871
01:47:23,508 --> 01:47:24,508
And I'm doing
a story about it.

1872
01:47:24,593 --> 01:47:25,993
No, no, you can't.
That's private.

1873
01:47:26,46 --> 01:47:26,995
Ok, mrs. Mckinney--

1874
01:47:27,48 --> 01:47:27,997
My son's upset
about it.

1875
01:47:28,83 --> 01:47:29,417
It was
a social studies thing,

1876
01:47:29,452 --> 01:47:31,86
And it didn't work out
the way he wanted it to.

1877
01:47:31,122 --> 01:47:32,122
Social studies?

1878
01:47:32,174 --> 01:47:33,491
Yeah. Please
just leave it alone.

1879
01:47:33,577 --> 01:47:35,411
He just wants to get on
with the seventh grade.

1880
01:47:35,447 --> 01:47:36,814
Seventh grade?
How do you--

1881
01:47:36,866 --> 01:47:38,417
Plus it's his birthday party,
and it's a bad time, ok?

1882
01:47:38,453 --> 01:47:39,420
I'm sorry to--

1883
01:47:39,454 --> 01:47:41,338
No, I'm sorry,
mrs. Mckinney.

1884
01:47:41,425 --> 01:47:42,341
I've been
tracking this story

1885
01:47:42,427 --> 01:47:44,11
From los angeles, ok?

1886
01:47:44,97 --> 01:47:45,681
Pay it forward,
the movement--

1887
01:47:45,767 --> 01:47:47,184
It's reached l.A.,
mrs. Mckinney.

1888
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:49,4
Come on, the movement?

1889
01:47:49,56 --> 01:47:50,373
Yeah. You're
telling me your son

1890
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:52,10
Had something
to do with this?

1891
01:47:52,96 --> 01:47:53,763
Aah!

1892
01:47:53,799 --> 01:47:55,433
Aah!

1893
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:57,369
Aah!

1894
01:47:57,456 --> 01:47:58,956
Aah!

1895
01:48:3,133 --> 01:48:4,200
[imitates crash]

1896
01:48:4,285 --> 01:48:6,120
We really appreciate
this, ms. Mckinney.

1897
01:48:6,173 --> 01:48:7,673
It's up to him.

1898
01:48:7,759 --> 01:48:9,260
Good.

1899
01:48:9,295 --> 01:48:10,596
Ready, slugger?

1900
01:48:10,631 --> 01:48:11,681
I guess.

1901
01:48:11,766 --> 01:48:13,834
There you go.
Up here, please, sir.

1902
01:48:13,887 --> 01:48:16,105
Just like you're
getting a haircut.

1903
01:48:16,142 --> 01:48:18,143
You ever been
interviewed before?

1904
01:48:18,196 --> 01:48:19,529
No.

1905
01:48:19,616 --> 01:48:22,67
Hey, trevor.

1906
01:48:22,154 --> 01:48:23,637
This is for you.

1907
01:48:23,689 --> 01:48:25,190
Hi. How are you?

1908
01:48:25,276 --> 01:48:26,276
What's your name?

1909
01:48:26,312 --> 01:48:28,563
Chris chandler.
Nice to meet you.

1910
01:48:28,649 --> 01:48:30,183
A little less painful
than a trip to the dentist.

1911
01:48:30,235 --> 01:48:31,869
You're gonna be great.
Just be yourself, ok, pal?

1912
01:48:31,939 --> 01:48:32,989
Ok.
You ready to go?

1913
01:48:33,41 --> 01:48:34,158
I guess.
You guess?

1914
01:48:34,210 --> 01:48:35,961
Come on, you gotta
have some gusto here.

1915
01:48:35,997 --> 01:48:37,80
Are we ready?

1916
01:48:37,166 --> 01:48:38,666
All right, let's go.
All right, great.

1917
01:48:38,718 --> 01:48:41,637
Ok, now, just be
yourself. Relax.

1918
01:48:41,674 --> 01:48:43,976
It's gonna be
a lot of fun, ok?

1919
01:48:44,12 --> 01:48:45,12
All right.

1920
01:48:49,489 --> 01:48:52,191
Ok, we're on?

1921
01:48:52,245 --> 01:48:54,729
Hi, I'm chris chandler,
and I'm joined today

1922
01:48:54,783 --> 01:48:56,733
By a very unusual
seventh grader,

1923
01:48:56,787 --> 01:48:59,255
Trevor mckinney.

1924
01:48:59,341 --> 01:49:0,625
Trevor,
you must be

1925
01:49:0,711 --> 01:49:1,928
Pretty proud
of yourself.

1926
01:49:2,14 --> 01:49:3,347
No.

1927
01:49:3,383 --> 01:49:6,101
So you're not
proud at all?

1928
01:49:6,188 --> 01:49:10,358
I don't know.
I guess.

1929
01:49:10,397 --> 01:49:12,364
Come on,
you start a movement

1930
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,267
Like pay it forward.
You're not proud?

1931
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:18,607
I guess. I mean, I got
an "a" in social studies,

1932
01:49:18,662 --> 01:49:21,564
But that was
just for the effort.

1933
01:49:21,618 --> 01:49:24,737
I mean, the stuff I did
didn't really work out.

1934
01:49:25,793 --> 01:49:27,210
You're here.

1935
01:49:27,245 --> 01:49:28,278
Yeah, but...

1936
01:49:28,331 --> 01:49:30,632
I don't know.
I tried real hard,

1937
01:49:30,718 --> 01:49:34,838
But nothing
really happened.

1938
01:49:34,926 --> 01:49:36,844
My mom's stuff
worked.

1939
01:49:36,930 --> 01:49:38,181
She talked
to my grandma,

1940
01:49:38,249 --> 01:49:40,17
Kind of made up
with her,

1941
01:49:40,87 --> 01:49:42,221
And it was
really hard for her.

1942
01:49:42,291 --> 01:49:43,808
It was great for me,

1943
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:46,595
Because my grandma came
to my birthday party,

1944
01:49:46,666 --> 01:49:50,786
And I had
really missed her.

1945
01:49:52,176 --> 01:49:53,510
And that's why
pay it forward

1946
01:49:53,595 --> 01:49:55,430
Went to all
those places...

1947
01:49:55,466 --> 01:49:57,166
'cause of my mom.

1948
01:49:57,220 --> 01:50:1,606
'cause
she was so brave.

1949
01:50:1,678 --> 01:50:3,479
My stuff,
I--I don't know.

1950
01:50:3,532 --> 01:50:6,501
I think some people are
too scared or something.

1951
01:50:6,570 --> 01:50:10,106
I think things
can be different...

1952
01:50:10,178 --> 01:50:12,463
And, I mean,
the world's--

1953
01:50:12,499 --> 01:50:16,201
The world's
not exactly...

1954
01:50:16,256 --> 01:50:18,223
Shit.

1955
01:50:20,247 --> 01:50:22,699
But I guess it's hard
for some people

1956
01:50:22,768 --> 01:50:25,453
Who are so used to things
the way they are--

1957
01:50:25,491 --> 01:50:28,393
Even if they're bad--

1958
01:50:28,463 --> 01:50:31,882
To change...

1959
01:50:31,953 --> 01:50:35,172
And they kind of give up.

1960
01:50:39,351 --> 01:50:43,237
When they do,
everybody kind of...

1961
01:50:43,324 --> 01:50:45,25
Kind of loses.

1962
01:51:12,330 --> 01:51:13,831
Arlene...

1963
01:51:16,923 --> 01:51:18,90
I don't want to be
one of those people

1964
01:51:18,142 --> 01:51:20,293
He's talking about,

1965
01:51:20,346 --> 01:51:22,481
And I've become one.

1966
01:51:25,857 --> 01:51:26,806
I don't want
to spend

1967
01:51:26,859 --> 01:51:28,276
Another second
of wasted air.

1968
01:51:31,367 --> 01:51:34,653
Please don't let me stay
trapped in here forever.

1969
01:51:34,707 --> 01:51:35,841
I won't.

1970
01:51:35,926 --> 01:51:36,843
I don't
want to spend

1971
01:51:36,928 --> 01:51:38,545
Another second
without you.

1972
01:51:49,235 --> 01:51:52,353
Girl: Trevor,
that was awesome.

1973
01:51:52,441 --> 01:51:54,191
See you later, guys.

1974
01:51:54,278 --> 01:51:55,194
Boy: Tomorrow, right?

1975
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:56,480
Bye, man.

1976
01:51:59,37 --> 01:52:0,687
Let me go!
Stop it!

1977
01:52:0,774 --> 01:52:1,640
Who'd you tell?

1978
01:52:1,692 --> 01:52:2,809
Stop it!

1979
01:52:2,861 --> 01:52:4,312
Who'd you tell,
tattletale?

1980
01:52:4,364 --> 01:52:6,148
I didn't tell anybody.

1981
01:52:6,201 --> 01:52:7,785
Ah, ah, ah!

1982
01:52:7,821 --> 01:52:11,190
I swear I didn't
say anything!

1983
01:52:11,244 --> 01:52:12,311
Help!

1984
01:52:14,734 --> 01:52:17,603
Let me go.
Stop it.

1985
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:18,640
Trevor!

1986
01:52:23,601 --> 01:52:24,601
Come here.

1987
01:52:28,611 --> 01:52:29,961
Eugene: Hey!
Let me go!

1988
01:52:30,13 --> 01:52:31,430
Trevor!

1989
01:52:31,482 --> 01:52:34,768
No, trevor! Hey!

1990
01:52:34,823 --> 01:52:36,190
Get out of my face!

1991
01:52:36,275 --> 01:52:37,242
Punch him. Come on!

1992
01:52:38,430 --> 01:52:39,480
No!

1993
01:52:40,467 --> 01:52:41,734
Eugene: Leave him alone!

1994
01:52:41,786 --> 01:52:42,869
Trevor!

1995
01:52:42,921 --> 01:52:44,339
Trevor?

1996
01:52:44,374 --> 01:52:46,41
Unh!

1997
01:52:50,503 --> 01:52:51,970
Trevor?!

1998
01:53:3,544 --> 01:53:5,829
Someone get
an ambulance!

1999
01:54:0,971 --> 01:54:4,357
Trevor: But I guess it's hard
for some people who are...

2000
01:54:4,394 --> 01:54:6,595
So used to things
the way they are--

2001
01:54:6,649 --> 01:54:10,702
Even if they're bad--
to change...

2002
01:54:10,740 --> 01:54:13,41
Because...

2003
01:54:13,78 --> 01:54:15,946
I guess they kinda give up.

2004
01:54:16,0 --> 01:54:20,53
And when they do...

2005
01:54:20,92 --> 01:54:23,594
Everybody kinda loses.

2006
01:54:24,684 --> 01:54:26,568
Newsman: These moments
make you sorry

2007
01:54:26,604 --> 01:54:28,572
To have to report
anything at all.

2008
01:54:28,608 --> 01:54:31,76
This remarkable young man
died at 7:35 this evening.

2009
01:54:31,113 --> 01:54:33,80
Newswoman: There are
now confirmed incidents

2010
01:54:33,117 --> 01:54:34,584
Of pay it forward

2011
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:36,86
In los angeles,
san francisco.

2012
01:54:36,123 --> 01:54:38,90
And in phoenix,
we're checking to see

2013
01:54:38,127 --> 01:54:40,94
If the 16
foster children

2014
01:54:40,130 --> 01:54:41,764
Who just received
computers

2015
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:43,935
Is in any way connected
to this movement.

2016
01:54:43,971 --> 01:54:46,973
Trevor: It's hard.
You can't plan it.

2017
01:54:48,479 --> 01:54:51,448
You have to watch people
more, you know,

2018
01:54:51,485 --> 01:54:53,620
Sort of...

2019
01:54:53,656 --> 01:54:55,624
Sort of keep an eye on 'em

2020
01:54:55,660 --> 01:54:59,129
To protect 'em, because...

2021
01:54:59,167 --> 01:55:1,718
They can't always
see what they need.

2022
01:55:4,811 --> 01:55:6,728
It's--it's like
your big chance

2023
01:55:6,815 --> 01:55:8,933
To fix something
that's not like your bike.

2024
01:55:16,917 --> 01:55:18,584
You can...Fix a person.

2025
01:55:18,671 --> 01:55:21,89
Chris: Is that what
you want for your birthday,

2026
01:55:21,175 --> 01:55:23,93
Everybody
to pay it forward?

2027
01:55:23,179 --> 01:55:24,847
I can't ask for that.

2028
01:55:24,883 --> 01:55:27,101
Sure, you can.
Why not?

2029
01:55:27,187 --> 01:55:28,271
Wouldn't work.

2030
01:55:28,356 --> 01:55:29,940
Why?

2031
01:55:36,956 --> 01:55:39,574
I already
blew out my candles.

2032
02:03:9,100 --> 02:03:10,200
